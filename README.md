# Red Dwarf: The Unabridged Subtitles
A collection of complete, unabdriged subtitles for all episodes of British TV show /Red Dwarf/. Initially created to power [The Smega-Drive](https://smegadrive.ganymede.tv) - a Frinkiac style screenshot archive and meme generator for /Red Dwarf/ - they are now being collected in SRT format and made available for direct download on [The Smega-Drive Episode Index](https://smegadrive.ganymede.tv/episodes) and GitHub.

**The primary aim for these subtitles is to be word-for-word accurate, due to their primary function being as an indexing tool. As such, many different accessibility barriers had to be ignored. Anyone wanting to use these as a genuine aide may struggle to consume them due to the increased amount of words over a given period of time on screen.**

## Usage
### Editing
Any subtitle editor should support these SRT files and allow you to import the appropriate episode video file to it while viewing and editing them. The software used to create these subs originally is [Subtitle Edit](https://www.nikse.dk/subtitleedit) and is highly recommended for anyone wanting to submit pull requests.
### Viewing
Using external subtitle files will depend on the video player used, and might require the renaming of files to match that of the video file itself, but VLC's [guide to subtitles](https://wiki.videolan.org/subtitles) is a good place to start for anyone who is unsure. 
### Notes on versions
These subtitles are (in the case of series 1 to 8) created using the Blu-ray version of the episodes. They should also be cross compatible with the DVD versions but if you find any issues, please feel free to let us know via the [Issues tracker](https://github.com/cappsyco/reddwarfsubs/issues).
