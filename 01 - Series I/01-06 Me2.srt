(DRAMATIC "2001"-TYPE MUSIC)

2
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,836
This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship Red Dwarf.

3
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,311
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak.

4
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:14,449
The only survivors were Dave Lister,
who was in suspended animation during

5
00:01:14,473 --> 00:01:18,355
the disaster and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold.

6
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,431
Revived three million years later,

7
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:23,433
Lister's only companions are
a life form who evolved from his cat

8
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,393
and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram simulation
of one of the dead crew.

9
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,995
We have enough food to last 30,000 years,
but we've only got one After Eight mint left,

10
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,959
and everyone's too polite to take it.

11
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:43,718
Let's see... "Astronavigation, Invisible Numbers
and Engineering Structure Made Simple".

12
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,711
That's Rimmer's.

13
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:55,717
Ah-ha! "The Pop-Up Kama Sutra:
Zero Gravity Edition." That's mine.

14
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,957
"Arnold J Rimmer - A Tribute."
what's this?

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,749
- It's a video of my death.
- You videoed your death?

16
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,958
- Holly did it for me.
- You're very strange, Rimmer.

17
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,237
What's so strange? You have
videos of weddings and births.

18
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,520
So, what do you do? Have a few people around, give them
a sherry and invite them to watch you snuff it?

19
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,534
Lister, my death is one of the most
important things that ever happened to me.

20
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:24,755
Just stick it in the trunk and shut up.

21
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,958
- Weird!
- What about these posters?

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,715
- Whoa! They're mine.
- But the Blu-Tack is mine.

23
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,648
You want to take the Blu-Tack?

24
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:36,636
It is mine. I did pay
for it, with my money.

25
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,603
There's one of your
old toenail clippings

26
00:02:38,627 --> 00:02:40,509
under the bed. I'll
put that in too shall I?

27
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:45,754
Ahhh, Lister. This is the best decision I ever made.
No more you and your stupid annoying face.

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,993
- No more you and your stupid annoying habits.
- Me? What did I do?

29
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,711
You hummed.
Maliciously and persistently for two years.

30
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,440
Every time I sat down to do some revision...

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,954
(HUMS ANNOYINGLY)

32
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,029
Hang on a minute, Are you
trying to say you never became an

33
00:03:01,053 --> 00:03:03,352
officer because your shared your
quarters with someone who hummed?

34
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,909
Obviously not just that, Lister. Everything!

35
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,804
Everything you ever did was
designed to hold me back and annoy me?

36
00:03:08,828 --> 00:03:09,755
Like what?

37
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,309
Like using my mother's photograph
as an ashtray.

38
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,274
I didn't know! I thought
it was a souvenir from Titan Zoo.

39
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,634
Exchanging the symbols
on my revision timetable,

40
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,997
so instead of taking my
Engineering finals, I went swimming.

41
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,551
The symbols fell off!
I thought I put them back in the right place.

42
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,076
Swapping my toothpaste
for a tube of contraceptive jelly.

43
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,676
Come on! That was a joke.

44
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,879
Yes, Lister, the same kind of joke as
putting my name down on the waiting list

45
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,520
for experimental pile surgery.

46
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,955
It's not all one-way you know, Rimmer.

47
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,511
- You're hardly Mr Nice Guy, Mr Easy-To-Live-With?
- What are you talking about?

48
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,718
I'm talking about playing your self-hypnosis tapes all through the night.

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,394
"Learn Esperanto While You Sleep."

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,074
"Learn Quantum Theory While You Sleep."

51
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,119
- We both got the same benefit.
- Yeah, neither of us got any sleep.

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,273
And what about the time you tied me hair
to the bedpost, then sounded the fire alarm!

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,831
Lister, I did that because I was sick of you annoying me.
I don't have to explain it!

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,957
I nearly needed brain surgery!

55
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,411
What brains? The point is, you've
always stopped me being successful.

56
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:18,716
That's a scientific fact.

57
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:22,191
Rimmer, you can't blame me for your lousy life.

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,318
- Oh, yes, I can.
- See! It's always the same.

59
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,397
You never had the right sort
of pens for your G&E drawing.

60
00:04:28,421 --> 00:04:30,520
Your dividers don't
stretch far enough.

61
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,591
- Well, they don't!
- See?

62
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,709
In the end, you can't turn around and say, "I'm sorry
I buggered up my life. It's all Lister's fault!"

63
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,591
Well, I'm not, am I? I'm moving out.
Out of Slob City and into Successville.

64
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,079
What, you mean next door?

65
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:47,799
It's not the place
Lister, it's the company.

66
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,760
I'm about to share my life with someone who'll
give me encouragement and understanding,

67
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,719
the thrust and parry of meaningful conversation.

68
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,394
- Everything tickety-boo?
- Absolutement, Mr Rimmer.

69
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,471
I'll be along lickety-split.

70
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,871
Carry on!

71
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,111
What a guy!

72
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,636
I just don't know why didn't I think
of this before? A duplicate me, Lister.

73
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,350
Yeah, yeah... Shall I take this through for you?

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,798
Be very careful with that. It's an antique.
It's absolutely priceless.

75
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,715
"Absolutement", "tickety-boo", "lickety-split"...

76
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,633
God, "meaningful conversation"?

77
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,789
"Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer
and Second Technician Arnold J Rimmer."

(SIGHS)

79
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,639
Be very careful with that. It's an antique.
Absolutely priceless.

80
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,634
- Gosh, I just said that!
- Did you? That's incredible!

81
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,711
What a lovely story!

82
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,794
Why have you got "No smoking"
signs up when neither of you smoke.

83
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,795
Because they're our 'no smoking' signs and
we happen to think they look rather striking.

84
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:04,793
Whoa-ho-ho! What's all this?

85
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,351
"Arnold's Tops With Us", "I owe it all to Rimmer", "Arnie Does It Best"...

86
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,034
This is very funny stuff.

87
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:15,238
- Just go.
- I mean, because your name's Arnold Rimmer,

88
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:18,676
and even though these headlines
are about other people,

89
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,276
you've cut them out and put them on the wall,
so people will think they're about you?

90
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,434
- Shoo! Go on, out!
- This joke's gonna keep me laughing all through the winter!

91
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,354
Lister, we don't have
to take this anymore.

92
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:31,999
We don't have to put up with
your snidey remarks, your total

93
00:06:32,023 --> 00:06:34,598
slobbiness, your socks that
set off the sprinkler system.

94
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:38,275
- Vacate our new quarters.
- Bye-bye, Rimmer.

95
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,591
No, sorry...
Bye-bye, bye-bye, Rimmer, Rimmer.

96
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,432
(BOTH) Goit.

97
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:54,238
Aow!
Hey! I'm looking so good today!

98
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,915
If I looked any better, I'd be illegal!

99
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,474
Hello, hello! Testing, testing!
One, one, one! Me, me, me!

100
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,191
Attention, all lady cats.
I am feeling very, very sexy!

101
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,749
Can you hear me, lady cats?

102
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,990
My body is available!

103
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,677

We're talking mega-ecstasy bliss!

108
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,320
I can hum as loud as I like, as long as I like.

109
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,437
I'm a free man.

110
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,632
And you see those socks? See 'em?

111
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,759
They're going right where they belong,
all over the floor,

112
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,390
where any self-respecting bachelor
would keep "em.

113
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:57,075
I'm gonna have the bottom bunk, the big bunk.

114
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,280
I'm gonna leave the top off the shampoo.

115
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,957
I'm going to squeeze the toothpaste
right from the middle.

116
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,910
In fact, I'm gonna do all the things
that drove him bonkers!

117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,153
I'm gonna crack me knuckles.
I'm gonna grind me teeth.

118
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,437
I'm gonna live for a change!

120
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,759
What's this? Video of Rimmer's death?

121
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,550
Holly, get us some popcorn
and put the video on for us, would you?

122
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,759
well, I can just about
manage that, I suppose.

123
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,558
"BSc", "SSc"? What's that?

124
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:54,519
Bronze Swimming certificate
and Silver Swimming certificate.

125
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,591
He's a total lunatic.

126
00:08:56,680 --> 00:09:00,310
Hello. This video pays homage to a man

127
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:03,995
who fell short of greatness by a gnat's wing.

128
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,039
Before we see a digitalised
recording of his final moments,

129
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,239
there's going to be a lengthy tribute,
interspersed with poetry readings, read by me.

130
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,311
Whoa! Spin on!

131
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,751
Poetry in motion.

132
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:20,598
..and if it hadn't been for those people

133
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:24,150
who kept dragging him down,
pulling him down, pulling him back...

134
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,231
Spin on!

135
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,312
..if you put Napoleon in quarters with Lister,

136
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,835
he'd still be in Corsica peeling spuds.

137
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,718
Spin on!

138
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,999
..we see the final moments of Arnold J Rimmer.

139
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,753
Yes!

140
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:47,870
Look, It was your job to fix it, Rimmer!
You can't do sloppy work on the drive plate!

141
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,830
I know, sir, and I accept full
responsibility for any consequences.

142
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,834
Emergency. There's an emergency going on.

143
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:00,276
Will Arnold Rimmer please hurry
to White Corridor 159...7

144
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,237
Gazpacho soup!

145
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,513
(LISTER) Off,

146
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,400
Gazpacho soup? Why were his last words
"gazpacho soup"?

147
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:18,836
Attention, lady cats! Sensual emergency!

148
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,991
Good lovin' needed bad!

149
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:24,072
Aow! Hey, no girls here?

150
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:29,758
What a waste of a good move! Shame.
I'm looking so dangerous, too!

151
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:32,195
Aow! Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah!

152
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,079
Cat, what are you doing?

153
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,197
I'm courting.

154
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:40,071
Courting who?

155
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,834
- Whoever shows up.
- I told you before,

156
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,230
there's no other cats on board.

157
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:51,794
If I believed that for one minute,
I'd go crazy! Aow! Yeah, yeah. yeah, yeah!

158
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,716
(RIMMER) Up, up, up! Stretch, stretch, stretch!

159
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,711
- Stretch further!
- And rest.

160
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,616
No! Keep jumping!

161
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,111
Absolutely. Keep on going
through the pain barrier.

162
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,191
- Jump, jump, jump!
- And rest.

163
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,318
- What are you doing, man?!
- I'm resting, it's going all grey!

164
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,666
That's the pain
barrier! Beat it!

165
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,995
You're right, you're
absolutely right. Keep it going.

166
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:21,596
- And rest.
- Brilliant! That extra little bit. That's what it's all about.

167
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,877
- What time do we get up?
- Ooh, early. Half past eight.

168
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,157
- No, earlier than that. Seven.
- How about six?

169
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,710
- No, Half past four...
- Half past four, that's the middle of the night!

170
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,314
You wanted driving. I'm driving you.

171
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,516
Once again, Arnold, you're absolutely right.

172
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,744
Holly, alarm call, 4.30
in the morning.

173
00:11:38,768 --> 00:11:40,912
Make it the sonic boom, extra
loud, emergency one.

174
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,752
Yes, Arnold. And Arnold.

175
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,754
- Er, what are you doing, Arnold?
- I'm going to bed, Arnold.

176
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:50,435
But it's 2 in the morning. We can get
in a couple of hours revision easily.

177
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,875
But, I'm getting up in a minute...

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,395
You take Porous Circuits and Esperanto.

179
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,359
I'll take Thermal Energy
and the History of Philosophy.

180
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,906
Fantastic! This is what I've
always dreamed of. I'm in heaven!

181
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,116
Better than sex.

182
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,631
It's 4.30.
Here is your early morning alarm call.

183
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,711
(FOGHORN, BELLS AND SIRENS SOUND)

184
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,950
(RIMMER) Off! Off! Off!

185
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,875
That's the way. Smooth and even. Up and down.

186
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,471
Ah, Lister. Bonan matenon.
Didn't wake you, I trust?

187
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,393
No, I haven't been to bed yet.

188
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,711
But it's 5.05 am. It's practically lunchtime.

189
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,791
What are you doing?

190
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,273
It's called work, Lister. I didnt' think you'd recognise it.
W-O-R-K. It is in the dictionary.

191
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,351
Come on, paint! Paint, paint, paint!

192
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:43,432
But why are they painting the
corridor, the same colour it was before?

193
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,720
They're changing it from ocean grey to military grey.
Something that should have been done a long time ago

194
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,033
- Looks exactly the same to me.
- No, no, no, no...

195
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
That's the new military grey bit there...

196
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,912
and that's the dowdy old, nasty ocean grey bit there.

197
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,360
Or is it the other way around?

198
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,035
It doesn't matter, Rimmer. It's very nice.
So, how's Mrs Rimmer?

199
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,150
Tee-hee hoddle ha! Why don't you just get back into your
cesspit or you won't have the energy for a full day's slob.

200
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,029
I just wondered what you talked about and that, y'know?

201
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,430
Millions of things, Lister.

202
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,911
Apart from being a complete genius, that man happens to be a total delight.

203
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,550
- Has me in stitches all of the time.
- But, he knows everything you know,

204
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,837
and you know everything he
knows, so what do you talk about?

205
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:33,915
We reminisce, chew over old times,
past glories...old girlfriends.

206
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,995
- Oh, you mean Yvonne McGruder?
- Don't say "Yvonne MacGruder" as if she's the only one.

207
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,071
Well, go on then, name one other girlfriend, then.

208
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:47,759
Lister, I'm far, far, far too much of a gentleman
to stoop to that shower-room mentality.

209
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:52,357
All you need to know about
Yvonne McGruder is I gave her one.

210
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:56,112
Fine, Rimmer, fine. Very nice. Very, very nice.

211
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,875
So, um...what's gazpacho soup?

212
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,556
What?

213
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,230
It's just that they were your
last words and I wondered why?

214
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,994
You've been watching my death video, haven't you?

215
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,959
That's private! It's for my enjoyment only!

216
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,999
It just seems like such a strange
thing to say, "Gazpacho soup..."

217
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:18,517
Well, I'm sorry, I didn't have time to sit down and
bash out a speech in iambic pentameter.

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,240
I was hit in the face by an atomic explosion.

219
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,311
But why "gazpacho soup"?

220
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,074
That, Lister, is something you will never ever know.

221
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,677
Arnold, you asked me to remind you when it was time for your Esperanto revision.

222
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:33,752
Thank you, Holly. You two, carry on.

223
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:44,116
"A to Z of Red Dwarf."

224
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,716
(CACKLES) I thought so!

225
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:53,912
"My Diary", by Arnold J Rimmer.

226
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,518
January 1st: "I have decided to keep a journal
of my thoughts and deeds over the coming year,

227
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,071
"a daily chart of my progress
through the echelons of command,

228
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,879
"so that perhaps one day, other aspiring officers

229
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,759
"may seek enlightenment through these pages.

230
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,992
"It is my fond hope that one day, this journal will take its place

231
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:18,200
"alongside Napoleon's war diaries
and the memories of Julius Caesar."

232
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,271
Next entry....

233
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,231
July 17th: "Auntie Maggie's Birthday."

234
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,435
November 25th: "Gazpacho soup day."

235
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,991
That's six weeks before the crew got wiped out.

236
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,599
He won't find that one.

237
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,149
Not until he changes his boots.

238
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,550
Oh! Did you see him clearly?

239
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:56,679
Did you get a good look at his face? Could
you spot him in a parade? I don't think so.

240
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,195
I could've been anybody.

241
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,956
Ten and three-quarter centimetres!

242
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,160
Plus five for not breaking,
and that is a big, big score!

243
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,735
The Browns have to do something
quite sensational with their last bubble.

244
00:16:18,759 --> 00:16:19,916
Quiet, please...

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,991
- Busy, Dave?
- (CHOKES)

246
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,071
Well, yeah, I am, actually.

247
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,631
Then you won't wanna know about the
super-lightspeed fighters that are tracking us.

248
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,119
What?!

249
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,636
- I'll leave you to your bubble blowing, mate.
- No, Holly, Holly, come on.

250
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:36,553
- They're from Earth.
- That's three million years away.

251
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,393
They're from the Norweb Federation.

252
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:45,394
- What's that?
- The North Western Electricity Board.

253
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,235
- They want you, Dave.
- Me? Why? What for?

254
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,233
- For your crimes against humanity.
- You what?!

255
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,028
Seems, when you left Earth
three millions years ago you left

256
00:16:55,052 --> 00:16:57,759
two half-eaten German
sausages on a plate in your kitchen.

257
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,913
- Did I?
- Do you know what happens to sausages

258
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,152
- left unattended after three million years?
- Yeah, they go mouldy.

259
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:09,598
Your sausages, Dave, now cover
seven-eighths of the Earth's surface.

260
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,435
Also, you left £17.50 in your bank account.

261
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,395
Thanks to compound interest,
you now own 98% of the world's wealth.

262
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,759
And because you've hoarded it for three million years, nobody's got
any money except for you and Norweb.

263
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,831
Why Norweb?

264
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,151
You left a light on in the bathroom.

265
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:33,073
I've got a final demand here
for £180 billion.

266
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,437
£180 billion?! You're kidding?!

267
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,716
April Fool,

268
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,071
But it's not April.

269
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,394
Yeah, I know, but I could hardly wait six months
with a red-hot jape like that under my belt.

270
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:50,120
So, you just made it all up, then?

271
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,477
Yeah. Bit of excitement for a while, wasn't it?

272
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,790
You can't beat a good wheeze. Hu-huh.

273
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,430
I don't need a good wheeze. I can do all the excitement for myself.

274
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,239
No, you can't. You haven't got a clue. You're useless.

275
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,734
- Shh!
- (RIMMER 1) Well, that's charming.

276
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:04,908
- (RIMMER 2) Shut up, Lister, will hear you.

277
00:18:04,932 --> 00:18:06,075
- What's that?
- (RIMMER) I make you vomit?

278
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,356
(RIMMER 2) Keep your voice down!

279
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,851
I'm not gonna stand
here and take this abuse.

280
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:15,674
Oh, yes! When the going gets tough, the
tough go and have a little cry in the corner.

281
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,994
You've got a sponge for a backbone!
No wonder father hated you!

282
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,720
That's a lie! A lie, lie, lie, lie, lie!!

283
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,247
Then why didn't he
send you to the academy?

284
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,839
He couldn't afford it!

285
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,799
Oh! He sent all our brothers!

286
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,554
You're a filthy, smegging, lying, smegging liar!

287
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:36,393
Face facts, man. Nobody
likes you! Not even Mummy!

288
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,393
Mummy did like me! Mummy was just busy.

289
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:43,189
- She had a lot of meetings to go to.
- Twaddle!

290
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,671
You better watch what you say about my mummy. I'm a grown man, and I'm not going to accept it-

291
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,320
-Oh, grow up, Mr Gazpacho!

292
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,677
- Mister what?
- I said Mr Gaz-pa-cho, deafie!

293
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,717
That is the most
obscenely hurtful thing...

294
00:18:58,741 --> 00:18:59,719
Good!

295
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:04,636
(RIMMER) That's the straw that broke the
dromedary, that is. You're finished, Rimmer.

296
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,360
(RIMMER 2) No, you're finished, Rimmer!

297
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,671
Ah, Lister... How are you?

298
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,511
I'm tickety-boo. What do you want?

299
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,514
I don't suppose you managed to get
that Blu-Tack together for me, have you?

300
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,557
Rimmer, it's 3 am!

301
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,188
It doesn't matter. It
can wait 'til the morning.

302
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm just gonna sleep
here, OK? Til you're ready.

303
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,799
- Everything all right, is it?
- Sure. Absolutely. Yeah, sure.

304
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,475
- No problems, then?
- No. No, no.

305
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,676
Things couldn't be hunky-dorier.

306
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,390
It's just that I thought I heard,
you know... raised voices?

307
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:56,278
It's quite an amusing thought, isn't it?
Having a blazing row with yourself.

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:02,313
(RIMMER 2) Hit the wall! Go on!
Hit the wall! Go on! Yeah! Yeah!

309
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,950
(RIMMER 2) Can you shut up, Rimmer. Some of us are trying to sleep!

310
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:09,396
Obviously, we have professional disagreements,

311
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:12,598
but I mean, nothing with any side to it.
Nothing malicious.

312
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:15,240
(RIMMER 2) Shut up, you dead git!

313
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,473
Excuse me a second, Lister, will you?

314
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:28,313
STOP YOUR FOUL WHINING, YOU FILTHY PIECE OF DISTENDED RECTUM!

315
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,639
Lister, there's no point in concealing it anymore.

316
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,554
Rimmer and me, we've had a bit of a tiff.

317
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:44,794
Nothing major...but it goes
without saying, it was his fault!

318
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,800
(VOICEOVER) Miles from Earth?

319
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:01,839
Deep in the heart of the Solar System
and you fancy a curry?

320
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:05,550
Then why not drop in
at the Titan Taj Mahal restaurant?

321
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,873
Enjoy the finest Tandoori cuisine
at one-fifth gravity.

322
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,271
Just a short space-walk from this cinema.

323
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,198
(CHOMPING)

324
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,430
- Shut up!
- Oh, will you stop doing that?!

325
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,194
- I'm trying to watch the film.
- I'm only eating!

326
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,079
No, eating's when the food goes in your mouth!
- Nyeh yeh yeh

327
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,876
- Afternoon.
- Yeah.

328
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,112
- What's on?
- "Orson Welles. Citizen Kane."

329
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:39,717
There's no smoking on this side.
You should be sitting over there.

330
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,440
- Nobody's complaining.
- Yes, they are. I am.

331
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:47,390
So, will you kindly move to the proper designated
smoking area for the convenience of other patrons.

332
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,436
I thought you hated films.

333
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:54,751
Me? No. I did a film course at night school.

334
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,719
"Citizen Kane", eh? That's... that's Orson Welles, is it?

335
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,759
Ah, that's "Citizen Kane" all right. Unmistakable.

336
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,434
Why are you here? Where's your wife?

337
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,797
Don't ask me. He's nothing to do with me anymore.

338
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,180
Last time I saw, he was
re-doing my paint work.

339
00:22:12,204 --> 00:22:15,910
Changing it from military grey back
to ocean grey. He's quite, quite mad!

340
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,154
Lister. Cat.

341
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,591
Excuse me. I can't see.

342
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,273
Shh.

343
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,230
Excuse me, I can't see through the
back of your stupid, sticky-out-eared head.

344
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,994
- I'm trying to watch the film!
- Yeah!

345
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:38,471
- Move!
- Look, I just happened to choose a seat at random.

346
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,120
If you're unhappy with your seat. I suggest you move.

347
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,599
Right.

348
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,594
Now, where shall I sit? So many to choose from.

349
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,752
How about over there or over there?

350
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,831
No, that's a nice seat!

351
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:56,199
Look at this. Mr Maturity.

352
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,432
Will you two guys just grow up?

353
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:09,230
There's only one immature person
around here, and we all know who it is.

354
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,189
(STUPID VOICE) Hello.
What do you think of Arnold Rimmer?

355
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,078
(BLOWS RASPBERRY)

356
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,959
This can't go on. One of yous has gotta go.

357
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,439
(BOTH) Yes, him.

358
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:27,111
Look it's crystal smegging clear
which one of us have got to go.

359
00:23:27,135 --> 00:23:27,990
Yes, you!

360
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,550
Look, I was here first. I nursed Listie through those early, delicate days!

361
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:35,998
We are identical. We're exactly the same person.
Only you're mentally unstable.

362
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,391
Ippy-dippy, my spaceshippy,
on a course so true...

363
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,633
Past Neptune and Pluto's moon,
the one I choose is you.

364
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,836
Excellent, excellent
decision, Listie. Turn him off.

365
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,350
And the one you end on is
the one that stays, yeah?

366
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,188
It's you, Rimmer.

367
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:50,478
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
just hold your horses, hang on...

368
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,676
It's your own fault, Rimmer.

369
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:55,439
If you'd given me Kochanski's
hologram, none of this would've happened.

370
00:23:55,463 --> 00:23:58,791
You made the bed, you lie in it.
Drive Room. Ten minutes.

371
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,871
Drive Room. Five minutes.

372
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,992
I don't believe it.
I've been ippy-dippied to death.

373
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,554
- I want you out.
- What have I said?

374
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,631
Just out!

375
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,916
There's precious little
entertainment on this ship.

376
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,437
I mean, if you can't attend the odd
execution, what have you got left?

377
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,238
Out! Go on!

378
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,956
(SNEERS) Don't forget to write...

379
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,077
you great nancy!

380
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,918
Lister.

381
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,278
Fancy a drink?
Oooh. I didn't know you had any medals!

382
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,351
What are they?

383
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,751
Three Years' Long Service,
Six Years' Long Service,

384
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,231
Nine Years' Long Service,
Twelve Years' Long Service.

385
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,359
- Come on, just one drink.
- I'll have a whisky.

386
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,954
- Holly, give him a whisky!
- How would you like it?

387
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:05,511
Straight... with ice and lemonade,
a cherry and a slice of lemon.

388
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,193
Another?

389
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,638
And another.

390
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,916
And another. Make it a double.

391
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,358
So, what's this gazpacho soup business?
What's it all about?

392
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,752
I suppose now I'm doomed, I can tell you.

393
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,710
Gazpacho soup.

394
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,475
It was the greatest night of my life.

395
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,996
I'd been invited to the Captain's table.

396
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:47,472
I'd only been with the company 14 years.

397
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,995
Six officers and me!

398
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,435
They called me "Arnold".

399
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,434
We had gazpacho soup for starters.

400
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,353
I didn't know gazpacho soup
was meant to be served cold.

401
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,709
I called over the chef and told him
to take it away and bring it back hot.

402
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,791
He did!

403
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:16,555
The looks on their faces still haunt me today!

404
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,076
I thought they were laughing at the chef,

405
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:25,633
when all the time, they were laughing at me
as I ate my piping hot gazpacho soup!

406
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,677
I never ate at the Captain's table again.

407
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:32,275
That was the end of my career.

408
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,833
Oh come on, anyone
could've made that mistake.

409
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,470
If only they'd mentioned it in basic training!

410
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:42,679
Instead of climbing up and down ropes and
crawling on your elbows through tunnels.

411
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,799
If only, just once, they'd said,
"Gazpacho soup is served cold!"

412
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,554
I could've been an admiral by now!

413
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,474
Instead of a nothing,
which is what I am, let's face it.

414
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:57,234
- Oh, come on, you're not a nothing.
- He is.

415
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,914
- You're right!
- I know I'm right.

416
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,752
I never got off the bottom rung.

417
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:09,040
And do you know why? Because
I didn't have the right nobby parents.

418
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:13,398
I bet Todhunter was served gazpacho soup
the moment he was on solids.

419
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,630
No, I bet he was breast-fed with it!

420
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,794
One side gazpacho soup and the other side
freely dispensing chilled champagne! Pfff!

421
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:26,589
Is this gonna go on all day?
I thought he was gettin' wiped!

422
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,395
Yes, go on. Turn me off. Go
on, turn me off! Get rid of me.

423
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:35,157
I've already done it. I wiped the other one.

424
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:40,519
What?! You wiped... When?!

425
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,126
Just before you came in.

426
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:45,151
And you let me stand
here and bare my soul?

427
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:51,555
Yeah! You see, I wanted to know about
gazpacho soup and I knew you wouldn't tell me.

428
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,348
Of course I wouldn't tell
you. You'd make my life a

429
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,352
hell with gazpacho soup
jokes for the rest of my life.

430
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,431
Rimmer.

431
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:04,435
I promise, I swear I will never,
ever mention this conversation again.

432
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,239
And when I swear, I mean it.

433
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,880
- You promise?
- I promise.

434
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,951
Do you swear absolutely?

435
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:16,432
I swear absolutely that I promise I will
never mention gazpacho soup again!

436
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,557
All right...

437
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,237
You're a bit of a slob, Lister y'know, but
when it comes down to it you keep your word.

438
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,960
This time I'm gonna believe you.

439
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,031
Let's go for another drink.

440
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,159
Souper!

441
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,995
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

442
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,436
# I'm all alone, more or less

443
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,638
# Let me fly far away from here

444
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,473
# Fun, fun, fun

445
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,076
# In the sun, sun, sun

446
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,516
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

447
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,877
# Drinking fresh mango juice

448
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:03,237
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

449
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,994
# Fun, fun, fun

450
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,755
# In the sun, sun, sun

451
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,514
# Fun, fun, fun

452
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,673
# In the sun, sun, sun #
