00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,998
I understand you played an idiotic prank on
a senior and much-respected officer yesterday.

3
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,356
That is just not true, sir. We played the prank on Mr Ackerman, sir... Oh, I see.

4
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,113
What happened?

5
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,309
We inserted a capsule of the truth serum
Sodium Pentothal into his asthma inhaler, sir.

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,154
Which is why he rushed onto the bridge
this morning, apologised for being late,

7
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:31,632
saying he'd been having jiggy-jiggy
with the science officer's wife,

8
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,033
and hadn't allowed enough time
to change out of his Batman outfit.

9
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,398
Permission to snigger, sir.

10
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,039
Permission refused.

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,079
May have to snigger anyway, sir.

12
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,676
- Do either of you have anything to say?
- About what, sir?

13
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,789
About Mr Ackerman. About him being late
and wearing a Batman outfit.

14
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,919
Has he considered being Tarzan?
Costume change would be much quicker.

15
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,235
You two are both serving a two-year sentence
in the brig. Do you wanna get out ever?

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,960
It's just that Mr Ackerman's so...

17
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,150
...horrible, sir!

18
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,391
I am not, sir!

19
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,197
I'm extremely nice!

20
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,476
Lovely, in fact.

21
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,315
Warm, caring, but most of all, nice.

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:31,553
Hence my nickname - Nicey Ackerman.
That's why I entered the service, sir -

23
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,238
so I could share my sunny disposition with
inmate scum who didn't have my start in life.

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,994
Sir, he's been horrible from the day we met him.

25
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,197
Today, we have a new intake.

26
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,119

27
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,639

If you want to speak, ask my permission.

31
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:12,356
- I was just saying how nice you seemed.
- You spoke again.

32
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,516
I was paying you a compliment, buddy!

33
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:23,800
I was saying you seemed to be a fair-minded
guy, not one of these psycho types.

34
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,439
You spoke again!

35
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,316
Come on. Back me up.

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,790
Hang on. Wait. I get it. I'll should shut up.

37
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,110
I'll shut up, now stop hitting me!

38
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,113
That is definitely the key...

39
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,432
- That is totally untrue, sir.
- Save it, save it, Mr Ackerman.

40
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:56,595
I thought long and hard about a suitable
punishment and I've come up with this.

00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,558
You and a team of your choice

42
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,759
will play basketball against a team of guards
led by Mr Ackerman.

43
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,389
God bless you, sir.

44
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:11,918
Where you will be trounced and humiliated
in front of the entire inmate population.

45
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:15,675
But sir, if we lose, Baxter and his cronies
will beat us to a pulp.

46
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,274
You'd better win, then.

- Where were you?
- Where was I?!?

51
00:04:45,336 --> 00:04:48,718
- You were supposed to be picking up Rice.
- I did. We're meeting for drinks on Thursday.

52
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,717
- Not that kind of picking up, you ninny!
- Buddies, we gotta stop arguing. We can't lose this.

53
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,816
- We've got it all taken care of.
- As soon as the guards swig their half-time juice.

54
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:01,263
Yeah, the Skutter's managed to smuggle
something out of the medi lab for us.

I couldn't remove my shorts until after midnight.

When I wanted a leak, I had to do
a handstand on the toilet seat.

I stopped the lift doors from closing -
I wasn't even catching a lift!

- Where did you get it, the medi-lab?
- Yes, sir.

I'm gonna have it crushed.

I went to up to the medi lab for a sick note,

accept it was possible to have athlete's hand.

We're on the punishment menu now.

97
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:01,240
- No chips, no ice cream, just the basics.
- Because we're on punishment detail?

98
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:04,678
Yeah. Kill Crazy reckons they
give us the cloning experiments

gravy slopped over to disguise it.

He swears blind the other day he
got something with two noses in it.

102
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,233
Of course he didn't.
They can't do that. It's illegal.

103
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,391
His starter sneezed.

104
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:25,677
- Jimbo Steele was a witness.
- Kill Crazy's insane.

105
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,231
He's got lots of strange ideas.
He reckons every time they flush a loo on a plane

106
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,711
it drops straight out.

107
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,757
And that's why you can't go to the lav
when the plane's standing on the runway -

108
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,911
for fear of skid starts.

109
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,960
- He's probably right.
- Of course he isn't.

110
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,919
- Why else won't they let you go, then?
- I don't know.

111
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,959
Maybe they're helping you break up your journey?

112
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,671
If they let you go to the loo first off, you'd
have nothing to do after you'd eaten your cheese.

113
00:10:56,840 --> 00:11:01,914
Nah, Kill Crazy's probably right. That's why
houses on the flight path are always so cheap.

114
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,037
- Because of all the flushing planes?
- Yeah, well think about it.

115
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,669
You can't sunbathe. You can't have a barbecue,

116
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,674
and you have to go out, you've got to
wear a washable hat and leg it to your car.

117
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:20,673
It's the noise. That's why houses on the flight path
are so cheap. 'Cause of the noise.

118
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,624
- The noise?
- Yeah.

119
00:11:22,648 --> 00:11:24,117
But they're half a mile up.

120
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,750
You'd never be able to hear
people on the loo from that distance.

- Not unless they were like my Uncle Dan.
- Not eating?

Yeah they used to be on Z-Deck. I wonder
if the Nanos have reconstructed them.

141
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:18,034
You can programme them
to do anything you want. Eat potato skins. You name it.

142
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:22,831
We could programme them to eat the skins
off the potatoes and leave the rest intact.

I know you think I'm a bit of a fusspot
when it comes to safety procedures,

165

Hey, buddy. We're in here.

What is the point of me giving my "Stay alert,
everyone" pep talk if no one is listening?

171
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,400
- What?
- Look at this.

172
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,873
What are they, Hol?

173
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:56,193
They look uncannily like something
you should be very, very afraid of.

174
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,431
- What?
- Mime artists.

175
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:04,832
The ones you get in trendy town centres that chase
you down the street and freeze when you look at them.

176
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,696
- And everyone laughs at you.
- I've never seen anything like this before.

177
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,635
A group of men who display all the normal
life signs but seem totally incapable of movement.

178

179

181
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:28,783
Somehow, this device appears
to have caused time to freeze.

182
00:16:28,807 --> 00:16:31,037
Obviously, they
used it erroneously.

183

..you up.

00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:14,356
It appears to be able to digitise time and then
download it and store it on a hard drive.

197
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:18,195
This pure time can then be uploaded
into objects or places.

198
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,874
- To freeze people?
- Technically, they're not frozen, ma'am.

199
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,830
- Merely operating in a different time stream.
- So you mean they're moving, just incredibly slowly?

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,914
About the same speed as the
average Little Chef waitress.

201
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,357
That's why they don't appear
to be actually doing anything.

202
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:41,916
So this device has the ability to make time
come to a complete stop. What else can it do?

203
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,191
What's happened? Kryten, why are you so big,

204
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:54,149
and why do I suddenly feel like a Vimto?

205
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:57,438
Wagh! You gotta get me back to normal!

206
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,596
Do something. I can't go back like this!

207
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,789
Why not? You may only be three feet tall,
but you're both as cute as buttons.

208
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:16,915
- What's happened to my hair?
- And what's happened to mine?

209
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,438
You look like the Turkish entry
in the Eurovision Song Contest.

210

It seems to have restored your hair to a previous
time period to the rest of you. Compensating...

Now, it's regressed your outfits
to a previous time in your lives.

And you still look like the Turkish entry
in the Eurovision Song Contest.

213
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:46,033
So, here's a question. Can you unfreeze these guys

214
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,034
but take them back in time
so they have no memory of finding this?

215
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,989
- I think so, ma'am. Why?
- If we can smuggle this thing back on Red Dwarf,

216
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,879
it can make our prison terms pass in seconds.

217
