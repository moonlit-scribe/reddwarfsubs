00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,471
(DRAMATIC "2001"-TYPE MUSIC)

2
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,480
Three million years from Earth,
the mining ship Red Dwarf.

3
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,916
Its crew: Dave Lister,
the last human being alive;

4
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,992
Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
of his dead bunkmate,

5
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,198
and a creature who evolved
from the ship's cat. Message ends.

6
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,229
Additional,
Loneliness weighs heavily on us all.

7
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,312
Personally, the only thing that keeps me going

8
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,713
is the thought that we are over 60 billion
miles away from the nearest Berni Inn.

9
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,799
For a mild stomach upset, take one teaspoonful.

10
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,440
For acute indigestion, take two.

11
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,999
Well, a highly enjoyable meal all round.

12
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,754
Obviously, you can't expect perfection first time,

13
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,231
but I was quite delighted with
the way my dumplings went down.

14
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,392
Rimmer, real dumplings, proper dumplings,

15
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,869
when they're properly cooked to perfection,

16
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:10,634
proper dumplings should not bounce.

17
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,473
True, but compared to what I thought
they were going to be like, they were quite... superb.

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,235
- So, how's the Cat?
- He's just sleeping off the stomach pump.

19
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,109
He'll be all right. The lamb was a bit of a flop, though.

20
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,556
The lamb? Everybody thought
the lamb was the cheese!

21
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,951
And that lemon meringue pie man, what was in that?

22
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:36,160
- I thought you liked that. You brought some back?
- Yeah, I wanted to try some out on my athlete's foot.

23
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,392
It's not easy, Lister, cooking... when you're dead,

24
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,791
you don't exist,
and you're made entirely of light.

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,759
That's your excuse for everything isn't it? Being dead?

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,913
I'm just trying to rehabilitate myself,
trying to do the everyday normal things

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,276
that most living people take for granted.

28
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,831
- You've got the skutters to help you.
- What? Pinky and smegging Perky?

29
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:00,754
What use are they?
It's like giving Blind Pew contact lenses.

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,595
- They only do what you tell them to.
- Ah, but they don't do they?

31
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,550
You say, "Keep an eye on that lamb,"
and they do, they sit there for three hours and watch it burn.

32
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,350
So, they've got no emotion, have they?
It's not built into their software.

33
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,752
Have you seen their broom cupboard?
It's full of pin-ups of John Wayne.

34
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,720
That cannot be right can it? Piled this high
with Film Fun magazines.

35
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,189
That's not the way spanners behave in my book.

36
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,430
Oi. What's happening, dudes?

37
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,511
- Hi, Hol.
- Guess what?

38
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,035
- (BOTH) What?
- Go on, have a guess,

39
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,556
- What is it vaguely about?
- No clues, just have a guess.

40
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,989
I knew you wouldn't get it.

41
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,515
- The post pod's arrived,
- What, the mail?!

42
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,036
It's been tracking us since we left Earth. Now we've turned round it's caught up.

43
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,475
Do you mean it's taken three million years?!

44
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,155
Yeah, that's about average
for second-class post.

45
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,473
(CAPS BANG)

46
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:07,671
See what I mean?
(HOLLERS LIKE RED INDIAN)

47
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:21,189
There's everything here, all the mail,
entertainment cassettes a new batch of movies!

48
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:27,276
Yo, the new Friday 13th movie,
Friday 13th Part 1,649.

49
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,196
Look, Casablanca! They've re-made Casablanca.

50
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,910
Philistines! I mean how could you remake Casablanca?

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,073
The one starring Myra Binglebat
and Peter Beardsley was definitive.

52
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,109
Yeah, I saw that one. Knockout.
"Of all the space bars in all the worlds,

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,999
"you had to re-materialise in mine."

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,072
Look, a cassette of a whole year of Earth news here.

55
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,800
And two seasons of Zero-G football?

56
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,670
- I'll see you in the spring.
- Uh-uh-uh. What are total immersion video games?

57
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:03,836
Where?! Oh, these are brilliant!
You can't get hold of these for love nor money.

58
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:09,199
These are like Venus' arms.
These are like Brooke Shields' buttocks.

59
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,557
- What are they?
- Well, they're computer games, aren't they?

60
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,759
But electrodes are inserted
into your frontal lobes and hypothalamus, right?

61
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:20,720
So, you actually feel
as though you're really, really there. Yeees!

62
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,792
Fine. Holly, there's something here for you. It's a video letter.

63
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,871
Bung it on.

64
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,431
- Strike a light! It's Gordon.
- Who's Gordon?

65
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,471
The the 11th Generation Al computer aboard
the Scott Fitzgerald. He's got an IQ of 8000.

66
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,599
All right, Hol? It... It's Gordon.

67
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,910
Awesome, his intellect, I tell you.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,879
Just sending on the latest move in our chess game.

69
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:53,717
My move is pawn, right? That's the little
knobbly ones down the front...

70
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,680
Pawn to King 4. Your move.

71
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,320
Well, I'd better sign off now.

72
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,550
See you, Hol. Bye.

73
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,990
H... How do you turn this off, then?

74
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,680
You were playing postal chess with him, were ya?

75
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,470
Well a chance to lock horns with an intellect of that calibre, I'd be a fool not to.

76
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,474
Pawn to King 4, eh? He's a sly one.

77
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,599
- So, who's winning, Hol?
- Well, he is really.

78
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,911
That was the first move.

79
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,277
- Me... Me..Me... You... Me...
- It's all junk mail, yours, you know?

80
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,352
Me... Me... Me...

81
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,671
You send off for every bit of rubbish going you do.

82
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,274
Just so you have some mail to open.

83
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,954
Me... Me...

84
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,476
"Please rush me my portable
walrus-polishing kit.

85
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:14,238
"Four super brushes that will clean even
the trickiest of seabound mammals."

86
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,632
"Yes, I am over 18, although my IQ isn't."

87
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,155
Me... Me...

88
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,800
Smeg! Outland Revenue.

89
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,115
Oh-oh-oh-oh! Outland Revenue.

90
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,071
8,500?!

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,633
8,500?! That's a lot of tax, isn't it, Lister.
How on Titan are you going to pay for that, eh?

92
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,075
I'm not. It's yours.

93
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,958
What?!

94
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,950
No. This is wrong. It's wrong. It's well wrong, Lister.

95
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,759
Relax, it doesn't matter now. They're not going to catch you now, are they?

96
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:52,789
What do you mean? Just because we're three million years
into deep space and human species is extinct?

97
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,793
That means nothing to these people. They'll find us.

98
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:01,159
- God, I'll be worrying about this all the time now.
- Me... Yo, another one for you.

99
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,834
"Rear Admiral Lieutenant General Rimmer"?!

100
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,272
That's from my mother.

101
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,351
Rear Admiral?

102
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,637
Every time I take an exam. I tell her I've passed.

103
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,315
It's getting embarassing now. I should be commander and chief of the whole universe.

104
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,710
- Do you want me to open it?
- Open it.

105
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,432
"Dear Rimmer..." Is this from your mum?

106
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,511
That's Mumsie.

107
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,511
This handwriting's terrible.

108
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:32,070
"I hope this epistle finds you adequately healthy

109
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:34,151
"to discharge your duties..."

110
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:37,312
Y'know, maybe I shouldn't
read this deeply personal stuff.

111
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,112
- Just get on with it.
- "I write to..." I can't read that.

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,195
Oh, "I write to inform"... "I write to inform you
that your father is dad."

113
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:52,478
Well, of course he is.
Maybe it's "your father/dad".

114
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,200
- "Dead".
- I can't make it out.

115
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:57,476
- My father is dead.
- What?

116
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,949
My father is dead.

117
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,316
Oh, yeah, it's an "E"!

118
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,438
That's what it is. Your father's dead, Rimmer!

119
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,592
Oh, eh. Sorry.

120
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,756
Is that all she says?

121
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:23,311
Just that he passed away peacefully in his Jeep.

122
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,398
Sleep.

123
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,756
- Can't sleep?
- Hmm.

124
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:01,436
- (SIGHS) No, me, neither.
- Hmmm.

125
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:05,639
I remember when my dad died you know. I was only six.

126
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,476
I got loads of presents off everyone
like it was Christmas.

127
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,439
I remember wishing a couple more people would die,

128
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,989
so I could complete me Lego set.

129
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:22,437
My grandma tried to explain, you know. She said
he'd gone away and wasn't coming back.

130
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,511
So, I wanted to know where like. you know?

131
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,118
She said he was very happy and he'd gone
to the same place as me goldfish.

132
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,750
So, I thought they'd flushed him down the bog.

133
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,073
I thought he was just
round the U-bend, you know?

134
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,791
I used to stuff food down
and magazines and that for him to read.

135
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,349
They took me to a child psychologist in the end.

136
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,389
cause they found- they found me with my head down
the bowl reading him the football results.

137
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,991
I knew he was dead.

138
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,799
I mean, they're all dead, aren't they?

139
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,430
But it's just, getting that letter makes it seem
like it happened yesterday.

140
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,996
- You never said much about him.
- No.

141
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,833
- You must have been pretty close.
- Close?

142
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,070
- Sorry. Very close.
- Close?

143
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,271
I hated him.

144
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:20,116
I detested his fat, stupid guts,
the pop-eyed, balding git.

145
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,909
- Eh?
- He always wanted to join the Space Corps,

146
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,959
be an officer, but they wouldn't take him
because he was an inch below regulation height.

147
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:30,031
One inch.

148
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:32,111
I had three brothers.

149
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:36,558
When we were young, he bought
a traction machine so that he could stretch us.

150
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,476
By the time my brother Frank
was eleven, he was six foot five.

151
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,509
Every morning, he'd measure us.
If we hadn't grown, back on the rack.

152
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,069
Sounds like he had a screw loose.

153
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:53,154
I don't think he had one screw fully
tightened, to be perfectly honest with you.

154
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,596
He had this fixation that we all
had to get into the Space Corps.

155
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:00,389
At meal times, he'd ask us questions
on astronavigation.

156
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,951
- If we got them wrong, no food.
- God, Rimmer. How did you cope with that?

157
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:08,396
I didn't. I nearly died of malnutrition.

158
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,393
I had no idea. I thought you adored your parents.

159
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:15,110
- When I was 14, I divorced them.
- What?

160
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,316
I took them to court.

161
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,869

look up to him. It was only natural. He was my father.

There's nothing natural

- For what?
- For something, for anything.

Archaeologists near Mount Sinai have discovered

176
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,153
what is believed
to be a missing page from the Bible.

177
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,039
The page is presently being carbon dated in Bonn.

178
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,398
If genuine, it belongs at the beginning
of the Bible, and is believed to read...

- Rimmer, what happened to you?
- Lister.

325
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,469
Ah, this a great game, Lister.
I couldn't be happier.

326
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,710
Who are all those guys?

327
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,360
It's McGruder. She got pregnant,

328
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,432
so this morning, she made me marry her,

329
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,512
and this afternoon, we had seven kids.

330
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,591
Bliss.

331
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,671
Where's your E-Type?

332
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,310
It was too impractical, with all the kids and everything.

333
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,392
Rimmer, you fantasise that you
had seven kids and a mortgage?

334
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,713
(WEAKLY) Help!

335
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:05,873
Arnold! Where are the nappy sacks?

336
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,194
My brain's rebelled. It just won't
accept nice things happening to me.

337
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,757
It just keeps fantasising... horribleness.

338
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,434
- Mr Rimmer?
- Yes?

339
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,796
Mr Arnold Judas Rimmer?

340
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:25,191
- Yes.
- Outland Revenue, sir.

341
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,953
Oh, my God!

342
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:29,793
This is a demand for immediate payment.

343
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,630
18,000!!

344
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,031
If you are unable to pay, sir I am instructed by the Revenue

345
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:41,636
to break your legs and pull off your thumbs... sir.

346
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:44,394
What am I going to do? I'm broke.

347
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,313
I'll pay, man. I'll pay- I'll Pay-.

348
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,551
Where's all me money gone?

349
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,511
Oh, no! I just fantasised it all away.
This is getting worse. Help me, please!

350
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,231
Aarrgh, don't move! A huge, black, furry spider
with big teeth just crawled up your trouser leg!

351
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:08,713
I know! I just put it there! It's the thing I'm afraid of
most in the whole world, a tarantula crawling up my trousers!

352
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,077
- Rimmer, This is getting out of hand!
- Do you think I don't know that?!

353
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,231
Argh! He's passed my knees, he's into my boxers.

354
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,630
- Close your eyes and wish it away.
- I can't!

355
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,791
- Concentrate, man!
- I can't!

356
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,031
Ah. What's he done now?

357
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,270
- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry!
- What's going on?

358
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,069
Our faces have been smeared with jam and we're about to be eaten alive by killer ants.

359
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,356
- Why?!
- Why not?

360
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,637
Cor, dear. You can't take him anywhere, can you?

361
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,874
- You've ruined this, Rimmer!
- We're going to die! We're going to die and it's my fault!

362
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,758
(ALL SCREAM)

363
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,954
(ALL SCREAM)

364
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:48,351
- You're a total dinglebat aren't you, Rimmer?
- I'm sorry!

365
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,149
Yeah, we were having a great time
until you came along with your diseased brain.

366
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,231
You're a bozo.

367
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,199
I can't help it, nice things just don't happen to me.

368
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,477
- Hey, what's that?
- It's a letter and it's for Rimmer.

369
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,399
"Dear sir, due to a computer error,

370
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,872
"you were wrongly informed that you
had failed the astronavigation exam.

371
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:14,830
"In fact, you passed with honours and you are hereby promoted
to Navigation Officer First Class.

372
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:19,551
"We enclose your pips and insignia."
Smegging hell!

373
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:23,599
Who said you was a loser, eh?
Who said nice things never happen to you?

374
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,720
- I did!
- Whoa, we're still in the game!

375
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:30,430
You certainly are. Now, what about my 18 grand?

376
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:35,196
Come on, it's bone-crunching time, my old china.
Now, where's those little thumbies?

377
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,758
# It's cold outside

378
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,638
# There's no kind of atmosphere

379
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,076
# I'm all alone, more or less

380
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,278
# Let me fly far away from here

381
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:53,113
# Fun, fun, fun

382
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,716
# In the sun, sun, sun

383
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,156
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

384
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,517
# Drinking fresh mango juice

385
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,877
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

386
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,634
# Fun, fun, fun

387
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:13,395
# In the sun, sun, sun

388
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:16,154
# Fun, fun, fun

389
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,313
# In the sun, sun, sun #
