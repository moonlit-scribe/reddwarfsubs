00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,920
Hey-hey, Officer Smegski.

4
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,560
How's it going, non bud?

5
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,840
I'm busy, don't disturb me.

6
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,920
Last time you disturbed me,
I was doing the safety check.

7
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,360
And, I failed to notice
that the diesel decks were flooded.

8
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,840
All I said was, "Help, I'm on fire."

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,240
And it distracted me. I had to break off
from what I was doing and put you out.

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,480
I was just cooking, is that a crime?

11
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,200
As far as I'm concerned,
you're not allowed to cook.

12
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,680
You always get distracted
by your reflection in the spatula

13
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,560
Man, that is such a cliché.

14
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,720
I can look at myself in a mirror
without getting distracted.

15
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:31,040
Hey, guys.

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,800
Cat.

17
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,480
Cat.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
- Cat!
- Wh... Wha... What?

19
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,080
(STUTTERING) Where am I?
What's happening?

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:41,200
You'll never guess what me
and Kryten have found.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,760
We've been going through Human Resources

22
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,920
and found Captain Hollister's
crew appraisal files.

23
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,360
You shouldn't be reading those.
They're for the Captain's eyes only.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,040
Why do you think we're reading them?

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,120
This is mine. Check this.

26
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:58,800
David Lister, although clearly
quite bright, is lazy, slovenly,

27
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,640
rebellious, unreliable,
rude and disorganized.

28
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,160
You hear that?
He thought I was quite bright.

29
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,800
How cool is that?

30
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,080
- Let me see mine.
- No, no, no.

31
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:10,760
He'll only read the good parts.

32
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,200
Lister, hand it over.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,680
Okay. This is you.

And even if I do, I got that off my Mum.
She's a huge blamer.

It's not my fault
I never made anything of myself.

How's it our fault?

48
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,760
You're supposed to surround yourself
with people who are brighter

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,040
and more successful than you.

50
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:06,320
You have.

51
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:09,720
Quite bright.

53
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm trying to get Mr. Lister
to adopt a healthier lifestyle.

of getting a vampire
to eat garlic bread.

56
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,680
Goodness, have you seen this
on the mid-range scan?

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,200
It's quite terrifying!

58
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,960
I've told Lister a hundred times

59
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,760
not to use my passport photo
as the screen saver.

60
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
Front on has never been my best side.

Freddie Mercury, is beyond me.

Just clean it off.

00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:56,480
No, sir, you don't understand,
the scanner's picked something up.

65
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,720
What is that?

66
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,320
It appears that some kind of anomaly
has penetrated our universe.

67
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,560
I hate people who use the word anomaly,

68
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,520
they think they're so cool.

anomalling away.

"I'm really cosmologically 'on trend'
because I know what 'anomaly' means."

71

It's just a fancy-smancy word for weird.

Sir, something weird
has penetrated our universe

00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,760

a giant lesion

across the space-time continuum.

75

Is it okay to say 'lesion', sir?
Or would you prefer me to say 'cut'?

Lesion, cuts,
they're both the same to me,

77

who say continuum I can't stand.

it's heading our way.

with the really calm voice

I ain't making you coffee.

101
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,640

102
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,160
Cheers, man.

103
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
I just made that?

104
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,440
When did I just make that?

105
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,920
Why did I just make that?

106
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,160
What the hell's going on?

107
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,120
I don't know, but I like it.
Got any biscuits?

108
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,360

had he been in the exact same situation:

- 'Et?"
- According to the computer,

120
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,280
I haven't requested a damage report.

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,000
- But I just saw you request one.
- And I did, sir.

a damage report, instead...

Can Mr. Lister and Mr. Cat

128

please make their way
to the science room.

How did I get here?

130
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
I didn't see you move.

131
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,040
I wonder.

00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:51,840
Permission to try an anomalous,
I mean weird, experiment, sir.

133
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,480
- How weird?
- Just moderately weird, sir,

134
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,040
say a 1989 Michael Jackson.

135
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,920
Now, here's what I want you to do.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,480
Make a decision
and if my theory is correct,

137
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,960
when you've made the decision,

138
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,880
the choice you don't make
will be the result.

139
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,440
The choice I don't make?

140
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
I have it.

141
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,520
What would you like me
to throw you, sir?

142
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,480
This apple or this orange?

143
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,800
The apple.

144
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,280
What? That's not possible.

145
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
You threw me an apple.

146
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,480
Well, according to the Many Worlds
interpretation of reality,

147
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:30,680
every choice not taken results
in the formation of a new universe

148
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,520
that creates a new timeline

149
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,560
and plays out the choice not taken.

150
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,000
But now, due to the lesion,

151
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,880
we are getting the results
of the choices we haven't made

152
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,120
feeding back to us.

153
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,520
That's more than
moderately weird, Kryten.

154
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,960

I think I know,
but I need to test me theory.

So, test it!

I don't get it.

170

Whatever choice you make,
the choice you don't make happens.

171

We should go tell Kryten
and helicopter landing pad head.

Good idea, but first tidy my bunk.

Oh! I get it now.

Oh, do you?

00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,120
- Yeah.
- Well. Polish my boots.

177
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:52,240
(HESITATINGLY) I ain't, not going
to not polish your boots.

178
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,280
Damn it!

179
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,240
You miscounted your ain't and nots.

180
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,160
So what's the plan?

181
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,760
Well, I say, let's not walk down
the corridor

182
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,480
and not get the lift
to the Science Room.

183
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,200
- And not find the others?
- Exactly.

184
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,720
My kind of mission, let's do nothing.

185
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,960
(BUZZES)

186
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,400
You had a choice to make
between the lift and the stairs.

187
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,600
I didn't think and just chose the lift.

188
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,760
So here we are, on the stairs.

189
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:31,160
Two hundred and twenty nine floors
above G deck.

190
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,000
So what are we gonna do now?

191
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,240
We just got to decide
not to use the lift

192
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,320
and continue walking down the stairs.

193
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,120
I think we're getting the hang
of this now. Whoo! (HOOTS)

194
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,320
No!
(BUZZES)

195
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,080
It was instinct!

196
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,520
Look, if you want to call a lift,
you've got to decide not to call a lift,

197
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,040
and then, a lift will be called.

198
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,000
Hey, I'm not a moron.

199
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,680
Which in this reality,
makes you a moron.

200
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,120
It's just a question
of remembering to do the opposite.

201
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
So here's the plan,

202
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
we're gonna continue
to walk down the stairs,

203
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,640
we're going to continue not to go
to the science room

204
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,960
where we won't speak
to Kryten and Rimmer

205
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,320
and we definitely won't find out
what the smegging hell is going on.

(BEEPS)

207
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,400
Have you figured out
what's hell's happening yet?

208
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
I believe I have sir.

209
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,920
May I suggest, we don't stay here
and we don't discuss

210
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,040
- the peculiar events taking place.
- Definitely not.

211
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,480
I don't agree with any of that.

212
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,840
Are you guys nuts?

213
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,400
We gotta stay here and figure out
what the hell's happening.

214
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
ALL: No!

215
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,000
You are so not a moron.

(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

217
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,200
As we all know, every single decision
every person rejects,

218
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,840
creates a new universe.

219
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,560
Which leads us to believe
there is a universe somewhere

220
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,680
where every possible thing
that could happen, happens.

221
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:02,120
So somewhere, there's a universe
where you get to the point?

222
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,040
And, a universe
where double denim with crocs is cool?

223
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,280
There'll probably even be a universe
where I return to my old ship

224
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,880
and apply for a new post.

225
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,760
I can just picture their faces,

226
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,760
"Oh, but you're just a bog bot,

227
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
"fit only for cleaning toilets."

228
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,360
And I say, "Just toilets?
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

229
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,600
"Is that what you think?

230
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,320
"So, how come I can do this?"

231
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,840
And I take them all down
to their Science Deck

232
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,440
and I mop that floor.

233
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,920
It makes you think though,

234
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,320
all those decisions
you've made in your life,

235
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:39,360
somewhere, a different version of you

236
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,240
is living out the opposite
of all your decisions.

00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,360
What a life he must be having,
that lucky bastard.

238
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:50,120
All the women who said "no" to me
in this universe, said "yes" to him.

239
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,120
Hmmm. All two of them.

240
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:57,280
So, what's caused this lesion?
Have we any ideas?

241
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,880
Well, I believe it may be a result
of an experiment I've been testing.

242
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
ALL: You?

243
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
I've been trying to create
a portable device

244
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:09,920
that allows the user to quantum skip
to other universes.

245
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,600
So, what's gone wrong?

246
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,960
It appears it's worked,

247
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,920
but I may have
slightly miscalculated the settings

248
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,440
and ripped a hole in space time.

249
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
So wait a minute,

250
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,880
you built a Quantum Skipper
on board Red Dwarf? How?

251
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
Well, not so much built as repaired,

252
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,000
it was among the tech we salvaged
from the Quantum research station

253
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,360
we visited last month.

254
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:35,120
So, hang on. Are you saying
if we tweak the settings,

255
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,880
we can fix the lesion
and Quantum skip between universes?

256
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,080
- Indeed.
- Why would we want to do that?

257
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,200
What's so great about here?

258
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
It's got me.

in this universe,

What about you Kryten?

262
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,480
I need to stay here
and look after Mr. Lister.

263
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:58,800
Without me, he'd fall apart
quicker than a Jabba the Hutt diet plan.

Oh, Kryten give over.

Kryten, when will this Quantum skipper
be up and running?

Well, I hope to have the lesion closed
and the skipper fully functioning

in a few hours, sir.

- So, you're going then?
- Of course, I am.

It's a chance for a new life,
a fresh start.

00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,040
He should do this.

Who knows, maybe
there's another universe out there

276
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,200
where he isn't such a giant loser.

Even with an infinite number
of universes,

278
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,400
that's going to take some finding.

Oh, not as such sir,

283
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,320
but all the dimensions

284
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,880
should, in some way,
be closely connected to our own

285
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,640
and skipping between realities should be
relatively straight forward,

286
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,520
although the Quantum skipper

287
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,520
does require recharge time
between skips.

288
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:05,040
So, what do I do
to quantum skip out of here?

Why so long? Come on, tell him!

You simply press this button here, sir

291
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,680

to a random universe

nobody's dead?

on board, so got thrown
into suspended animation.

a radiation leak, Arnold.

352
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,720
and it's sweeping it's way
through the ship.

353
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,240
We've lost the entire port side.

354

Not just the port. The sherry,
the brandy,

355
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,520
we've lost the entire bar deck.

What are you doing?

361
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,480
I was trying to go down with the Dwarf
do the right thing,

362
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,080
when suddenly,
I tripped into this escape pod.

363
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,880
Thought I was pressing the "get me out

"I want to die nobly
with my crew" button,

365
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,840
only it turned out to be
the "get me home fast" switch.

366
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,360
Now, it's launching.

367
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,320
Just press that emergency open switch,
take me with you.

368
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,880
I'd like to invite you along Rimmer,
but as you can see,

369
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,560
it's only a four seater,
so there's only room for me.

370
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,080

went down with their ships.

I've just Quantum skipped
from another reality,

than the one I came from.

Evening, chaps.

390
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,600
We have a new Mr. Rimmer, sir,

391
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,280
he's Quantum skipped into our universe.

392
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,880
That's a shame,
I rather liked the old Rimmer.

Is there something wrong with you?
You don't like me.

Of course, I like you,

and pees in the toilet simultaneously

397

even though the basin and the toilet
are in different rooms?

398
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,080
That's disgusting, I'd never do that.

399
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,400
Oh by the way, Kryten, later on,
I need your help.

418
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,240
because, you smuggled your pet cat
on board.

No, I got put into stasis

420
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,800
'cause I smuggled my pet rat on board

into these chaps.

to find the promised land

424
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,000
and had some
insane religious war, right?

524
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,560
they offered me some cash
to keep me schtum...

525
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:06,880
So you got a pay off?

526
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,240
No, I refused the settlement

527
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,640
and opted for shares. They said yes.

528
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:15,880
They had no idea we're gonna stumble
across a planet rich in Helium-7.

529
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,440
Made a fortune.

530
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,080
I can't live here.

531
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,400
- On Earth?
- In this Universe.

532
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,440
I can't live in a reality
where you're more successful than me.

533
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,120
But you're home, on Earth. You're alive.

534
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:33,920
You've got everything you ever wanted.

535
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,040
It's not worth it.

536
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,080
The pain of it would be...

537
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,680
...too much.

538
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,200
(BEEPS)

539
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,960
Oh, come on. One more hand I want to win
match sticks back.

540
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,760
Oh, sir, you're back. (CHUCKLES)

541
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,640
Did you find a universe
where you felt less of a loser?

542
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,400
Deal him in.

543
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:02,000
Infinite clearly wasn't enough.

544
00:27:06,924 --> 00:27:10,324
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

545
00:27:10,484 --> 00:27:13,804
# I'm all alone, more or less

546
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:17,164
# Let me fly far away from here

547
00:27:17,244 --> 00:27:19,964
# Fun, fun, fun

548
00:27:20,084 --> 00:27:23,644
# In the sun, sun, sun

549
00:27:23,724 --> 00:27:27,164
# I want to lie shipwrecked
and comatose

550
00:27:27,244 --> 00:27:30,404
# Drinking fresh mango juice

551
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:33,804
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

552
00:27:33,884 --> 00:27:36,604
# Fun, fun, fun

553
00:27:36,684 --> 00:27:40,124
# In the sun, sun, sun

554
00:27:40,444 --> 00:27:43,124
# Fun, fun, fun

555
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:47,324
# In the sun, sun, sun #
