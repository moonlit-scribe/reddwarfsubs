20

become an officer and command my own ship.

- A calendar?
- The other daya she looked at the old calendar

89
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,999
and said it was the wrong time
of the month, so I got her a new one.

90
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:07,151
I'll tell her - the calendar people
made a mistake,

91
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,836
but let's leave this whole wrong month thing
behind us. They were stupid, it was careless.

- Isn't he wonderful?

I could just eat him.

embarrass myself. Come on, then, open it!

way before it got into the public domain?

I've hacked into the ship's computer system.
Got into the prison log.

I've also managed to get a goosey at the supplies inventory.

- I wasn't at home, so I didn't feel stupid or anything.

in five minutes. We're on probation!

164
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:43,719
- Down the loo. Down the sink.
- Baxter's gonna kill us if he finds out we're doing this.

165
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,190
The captain's gonna kill us if we don't.

166
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:51,150
But Baxter. You've seen what he's like?
Grizzly bears run screaming from him.

167
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,675
Last week, he was playing poker, ran out of money.

168
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:58,789
He bet his right nut on a pair of jacks.
A pair of jacks - that's how hard he is!

169
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,196
Smeg! The tank's full.

170
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,478
What are we gonna do?
We've still got two bottles left.

171
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,517
We're gonna have to drink it.

172
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:11,753

It's about 300 per cent proof.

00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,835
- A bottle of this would get the entire Greek Navy drunk.
- It'll put hairs on your chest.

174
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,992
It'll put hairs on your lips!

175
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,278
It'll put hairs on your... hairs! It's lethal.

of illegal hooch? Get drinking.

be outta here by five o'clock.

about five o'clock?

the Hermes. It's on Red Dwarf!

How?

243
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:16,230
The microbe's chameleonic, so it must have been
the escape pod - the one Talia... whats-her-name arrived on.

244
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,473
- We've got to go back and tell them.
- What about our escape?

245
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:26,670
It could be days before they discover this. If
we go back now, they've got a chance to work on an antidote.

Yeah - the big picture involves you,
no clothes and a haystack.

249
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,551
Red Dwarf is being devoured from within
by a corrosive micro-organism.

250
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:47,190
As you probably know, we don't have enough craft
for everyone to be rescued,

251
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,319
so most of you will be staying behind to die.

252
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,996
Oh, there's an apology about that
in the internal mail.

253
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:11,240
Just as I suspected. Created in a lab
and programmed not to destroy glass.

254
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,518
So all we need is a plutonium-powered
greenhouse and we're home free.

255
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,629
We need an antidote. Something that will neutralize
the corrosive negativity of the microbe.

256
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:23,589
- Something with a corrosive positivity?
- So, where do we get that?

257
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,274
There's nothing in "Yellow Pages".

are diametrically opposite to this one.

There, negative becomes positive
and a virus becomes an antidote.

260

If there's even the slightest imperfection in the prism,
the mirror universe may be an imperfect version of our own.

so it's turned back into its opposite. (LAUGHS)

328
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,639
Smeg! You're right.

329
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:15,634
- This is a disaster!
- No, there could still be a happy ending.

330
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,189
- How?
- Remember that chocolate bar you still owe me for?

331
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,954
You could always pay me back before you snuff it.

332
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,111
How's that a happy ending?

333
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,830
It's a happy ending for me.
At least my totals will tally.

334
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,995
Why don't you smegging well smeg off, you annoying
little smeggy, smegging smegger?

335
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,074
Every dog has his day.

336
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,958
And today's the day...

337
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,793
..and I'm the dog!

338
00:27:50,236 --> 00:27:57,016
(# "Adagio for Strings" by Samuel Barber #)

339
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,190
Smeg!

340
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:29,034
- (HOWLING WIND)
- Arnold Judas Rimmer.

341
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,840
Your life is over.

342
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,389
Come with me.

343
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,115
You will travel to the River Styx
where you will place a coin...

344
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,271
- Not today, matey!
- Ohh...

345
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,439
Remember - only the good die young.

346
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,319
- (DEATH) That's... never happened before! (THUD!)

347
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,676
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

348
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:10,151
# I'm all alone, more or less

349
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,392
# Let me fly far away from here

350
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:16,359
# Fun, fun, fun

351
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:20,115
# In the sun, sun, sun

352
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:23,477
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

353
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,917
# Drinking fresh mango juice

354
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,357
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

355
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,080
# Fun, fun, fun

356
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:36,790
# In the sun, sun, sun

357
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,793
# Fun, fun, fun

358
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,318
# In the sun, sun, sun #
