00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,871
- OK, let's try again. What is it?
- It's a banana.

3
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,031
No, it isn't, try again. What is it?

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,714
- A banana?
- No, it isn't. What is it?

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,356
It's an urrrr... It's an urrrr...

6
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,597
It's an orange. Go on, say it. It's an orange.

7
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,435
- This is an orange.
- It's an orrrr...

8
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,912
It's an orrrr... It's a banana.
It's no good, sir. I just can't do it.

9
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,636
You CAN do it.
I'm gonna teach you how. OK, what's this?

10
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,275
- An ap...
- No, no, no, what is it?

11
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,758
Oh, it's no good, sir. I just can't lie.
I'm programmed always to tell the truth.

12
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,555
Kryten, it's easy. Look - an orange, a melon,

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:18,109
a female aardvark.

14
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,639
Oh, that is just so superb, sir!
How DO you do that?

15
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,030
Especially calling a banana an aardvark.

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,158
An aardvark isn't even a
fruit. Hahaha. It's total genius.

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,990
- Let's start again.
- Sir, my head is spinning, we've been doing this all morning.

18
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,477
Kryten, I'm going to teach you how to lie and cheat, if it's the last thing I do.

19
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,109
I want you to be unpleasant, cruel and sarcastic.

20
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,671
It's the only way to break your programming, man. Make you independent.

21
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,078
Well, I'm truly grateful, sir. Don't you think I'd
love to be deceitful, unpleasant and offensive.

22
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,313
Those are the human qualities
I admire the most. But I just can't do it.

23
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,357
- You can!
- I can't.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,312
- Look, what's this?
- No!

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,158
- What is it?
- Please!

26
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,397
- Come on! What is it?!
- It's a... It's a...

27
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:03,394
It's a small,
off-duty Czechoslovakian traffic warden.

28
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,876
Yes! You did it! You did it! What's this?

29
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,833
- It's a red and blue striped golfing umbrella.
- Kryten! Yes!

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,673
- What's this?
- It's an apple.

31
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,036
- No. What is it?
- It's a... It's...

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,800
It's the Bolivian navy on manoeuvres in the South Pacific!

33
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,069
- Kryten, man, you can do it.
- No, I can't.

34
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:22,039
Yes, you... ooh, ooh. Nice one!

35
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,359
Well, I can't hang around here.
I better go away and take the penguin for a walk.

36
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,114
I can do it! I did it again! I can lie!

37
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,477
- Cat, Cat!, come here. Come here. Check this. Check this.
- Check what?

38
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,200
Concentrate, Kryten. What's this?

39
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,516
It's a banana.

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,271
- What's this?
- It's an orange.

41
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,393
- What's this?
- (SQUEAKS) Apple.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,433
You taught him that? That's terrific.

43
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,638
You two should audition for "What's My Fruit?"

44
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,309
- He did it wrong, man.
- Oh, it gets better?

45
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,279
- I just can't do it.
- You can, you just did it.

46
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,030
I just can't do it, not when there's someone else there.
What's a suitable human analogy?

47
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,798
It's like trying to urinate in a public lavatory, when
you're standing next to a man two foot taller than you.

48
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,430
- It's just not possible.
- What are you trying to do, exactly?

49
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,359
- He's trying to teach me how to lie, sir.
- Any particular reason?

50
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,031
Yeah. Lying's a vital part of your psychological
defence system. You're naked without it.

51
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:20,551
If you can't lie, then you can't conceal
your true intentions from other people.

52
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,476
Sometimes that's essential.

53
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,716
I mean like, take Nelson, when he put the telescope
to his blind eye and said, "I see no ships."

54
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:32,670
Or like Humphrey Bogart at the end of "Casablanca", when
he lies to Victor Laszlo to protect the guy's feelings.

55
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,396
I understand the theory, sir.
How many times have you made me watch that movie?

56
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,996
I understand that it can be noble to lie.
I just can't do it.

57
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:43,192
Kryten, you can. Look, what's this?

58
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,671
It's a banana. It always has been a
banana. It always will be a banana.

59
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,196
It's a yellow fruit that you unzip and eat the white bits. It's a banana!

60
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:54,118
- Lister, have you got Kryten there with you?
- Yeah, what's the prob?

61
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,676
The problem is I've been waiting fully
20 minutes for him in the hangar.

62
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,714
Oh, spin my nipple nuts and send me to Alaska!

63
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:04,030
I'm supposed to take him asteroid spotting.

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,551
- I'll be right down, sir.
- You'd better be.

65
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,115
Kryten, remember yesterday's class, 'An Introduction To Insults'?

66
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,127
I'm not sure...

67
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:13,597
Now, how do we describe the
gentleman who's just been on the screen?

68
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,916
- He's Mr R...
- No, no, no. Come on. He's a...

69
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,072
- He's a smeee...
- Nearly. Come on. Nearly.

70
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,556
- He's a smeee...
- He's a...

71
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,230
He's a smeee... He's a smeeeg...

72
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,477
heeeeead.

73
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,631
I did it!

74
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:34,715
Brutal. Now the ultimate test -
can you say it to him in person?

75
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,355
Ah, Kryten. At last.
Glad you could make it this millennium.

76
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,278
Smeeeee....

77
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,156
- Pardon?
- Smeeeee...heeeee....

78
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,236
- What?
- You're a smeeeee...heeeee....

79
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,074
Oh, forget it.

80
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,432
(RIMMER) Kryten is there any possibility we
could we go just a bit faster?

81
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,359
I mean, so we're not being
overtaken by stationary objects?

82
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,477
Sir, you're a smeeeee...

83
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,919
- A smee.
- A smeeeee.. heeeee....

84
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,751
A smee-hee.

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,236
A complete and total one.

86
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:21,751
Hang about. I'm picking something up.
Some kind of distress beacon.

87
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,679
I copy that, Holly. Quadrant four-niner-seven.

88
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,996
- What is it?
- Hard to tell,

89
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,800
but whatever it is appears to be marooned on a planet in decaying orbit.

90
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,833
- What's the safety margin?
- Planet'll explode in about two hours.

91
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,159
- Forget it. It's too dangerous. Kryten, head for home.
- We can't just leave them there, sir.

92
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,631
- There may be survivors.
- Leave it, Kryten. That's an order.

(BLEEPING)

94
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,918
- What are you doing?!
- I'm not plotting a course, sir. Nor am I taking her down.

95
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,345
Yes, you are!

96
00:05:48,369 --> 00:05:52,069
Neither am I rendezvousing with the
crashed vessel, nor seeking for survivors.

97
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,870
Kryten, are committing an act of mutiny.
I could have you dismantled for this.

98
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,196
Smeeeeeg.... heeeee....

99
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,351

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,077
Not back yet? They've been hours.

103
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,794
- No sign. What are you watching?
- Oh, just a vid.

104
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,997
- This is a classic, man.
- What is it?

105
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,039
"Tales Of The Riverbank: The Next Generation."

106
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,875
Oh, right. I've seen this.
It's not as good as the original.

107
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,515
Well, they never really found anyone to replace Hammy Hamster, did they?

108
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,270
How could they? The dude was a diva.
He smouldered. The camera loved him.

109
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:33,233
Yeah. He was the rodent equivalent
of Marlon Brando.

110
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,750
Whatever happened to old Hammy?

111
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,231
One minute he's a huge star running
around on his own personalised gold wheel

112
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,631
with as much Edam as he
could hold in his little cheeks,

by landing on a planet that's about to explode,

120
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,793
thanks to your foundation course
in advanced rebellion.

121
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,789
- Why?
- So he can go and search some starship escape vessel

122
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,396
because there's a million-to-one
chance there may be a survivor.

123
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,416
What? And you let
him go off on his own?

124
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,856
Of course I let him go on his
own. I was glad to get rid of him.

125
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,996
He's flipped. He's got mad droid disease.

126
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,199
He kept waving a banana in front
of me and calling it a female aardvark.

127
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,635
Ah, well, hmm, you'd better get after him then hadn't you?

128
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,679
- I mean, he might need some help.
- Lister, this is your fault.

Hello? Is there anyone here?

130
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,551
Can anyone read me?

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,714
Oh, dear. What a terrible mess.

132
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,240
Ohh!

133
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,837
Help! Mr Rimmer, sir! Sir?

134
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,319
I thank you from the very bottom
of my rehydration units. You saved my life.

135
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,199
You responded to my distress call.
You saved mine.

00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,591
- My name is Kryten.
- They call me Camille. Pleased to make your acquaintance.

137
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,714
- Are you a 4000 series?
- Yes, I'm the 4000 series GTi.

138
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,629
GTi! Oh, wow!
I'm just a plain old 4000 series.

139
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,920
You've got all the luxury extras,
like realistic toes and a slide-back sunroof head.

140
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,549
Why are you looking at me like that?
Is there something wrong?

141
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:44,229
Sorry. Stare mode cancel.
It's just you have really amazing eyes.

142
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:49,719
Well...they're just the old 579s
with the automatic 15 F-stop cornea.

143
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:53,236
If you like, I could pop them out
and you could borrow them.

144
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,676
Oh, heck. What a jerky thing to say.

145
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,992
I don't believe you would ever say
anything which I would consider jerky.

146
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,713
- Really?
- Really.

147
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:05,039
Wow. Uh, listen,
I...I know this is going to sound like a corny line,

148
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,479
but has anyone ever told you that the configuration and
juxtaposition of your features is extraordinarily apposite?

149
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:14,071
- You really know all the lines, don't you?
- No, I really mean it.

150
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,437
The way the light catches the angles in your head -
it's enchanting.

151
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,951
- My name is Kryten.
- You already said.

152
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,596
Oh yes, Gosh. You must think me
as stupid as a photocopier.

153
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,434
So, where are the crew? What happened here?

154
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,877
Kryten, do you believe
in advanced mutual compatibility

155
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,600
on the basis of a primary initial ident?

156
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,110
You mean, what humans call "love at first sight"?

157
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,391
That would be an adequate synonym, yes.

158
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,309
Well, up until a few moments ago, I would have
said it had a probability of zero squared.

159
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,717
- And now?
- Uh... This gantry is unstable.

160
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,315
I suggest you hang on to me.

161
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,393
Oh, what is that fragrance? It smells divine.

162
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,319
- WD-40.
- I knew it.

163
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,199
I knew it. That's what I use on my neck hinges too.

164
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:01,518
 Kryten, this shouldn't be happening.
Do you feel it too?

165
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,111
You mean the 93.72% compatibility factor?

166
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,791
- I make it 93.75.
- Oh, yes. I forgot to carry the three.

167
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,556
Then say it. I want
to hear the words.

168
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:14,153
Oh, but it sounds so ridiculous
coming from a mechanoid.

169
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,715
- Then say them in machine language.
- OK.

170
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:22,000
In Z80012,  you see, hex rather than binary,
and converting to a basic ASCII code,

171
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,394
Camille, I think I E5-A9-08-B7 you.

172
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,637
- You really mean that?
- Camille, I'd do anything for you.

173
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:35,033
I'd compute a three-million-digit prime number with prime
roots, if I thought it would make you happy.

174
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,272
I'd evaluate pi to infinity if it would make you smile.

175
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:42,189
Oh, Kryten.
You make the most romantic calculations.

176
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,829
(RIMMER) Kryten, can you read me?
What's happening?

177
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,991
- There are others?
- Yes, why? What's wrong?

178
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,151
- I can't meet them.
- What do you mean?

179
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,358
The two of us alone, we could make that work.
Please, don't ask me to explain.

180
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,399
But Camille, this whole planet
is about to blow, there isn't time!

181
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,915
Please, I can't meet your shipmates.
Trust me.

182
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,879
But you don't know them. You'll like them.
Well, some of them.

183
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:04,271
Well, one of them...maybe.

184
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,431
Sir. I'm making my way back.

185
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,356
- What's kept you?
- I've found a survivor, sir. We're coming in.

186
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,199
Kryten, please don't make me do this. I'm begging you.

187
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,829
Now just relax. Everything's going to be fine.

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,320
Mr Rimmer, sir?

189
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,438
- Where the smeg have you been?
- Mr Rimmer, sir. This is Camille.

190
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,877
Camille, this is Second Tech Rimmer.
She saved my life, sir.

191
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,350
(DREAMY MUSIC)

192
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,230
Yes, well... Howdy.

193
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:42,670
- Howdy.
- You see? I knew you'd get along. Didn't I tell you?

194
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:47,471
Well, we haven't got much time. I'd better go and startup
the engines and get us clear of the impact zone.

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:52,117
- I'll come with you.
- No, no, no, no. You wait here and get acquainted.

196
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,350
Can I get you anything... or anything?

197
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,234
No. No, no. I'm fine, thanks.

198
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,756
I just can't believe I've met another hologram
after all these years.

199
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,391
- Yes. I was Second Technician aboard that crate.
- Second Technician, that's what I am.

200
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,150
I always wanted to go further,
but I'm a real dope when it comes to exams.

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,158
Me too.

202
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,831
So, er... what do they call you?

203
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,433
Well, my first name is Arnold,
but the guys generally call me... Duke.

204
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,036
Duke?

205
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,710
Yes, well they don't call me
Duke, not absolutely all the time.

206
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,510
In fact, sometimes months can elapse
and they won't call me "Duke" at all.

207
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:34,674
So don't call me "Duke" in front of anyone...
because they might have forgotten...

208
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,831
you know, that they call me "Duke".

209
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,236
Sorry, I'm blabbering, 
I'm not very good at small talk.

210
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,592
- Oh, I think you're perfectly charming.
- Do you?

211
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,355
Well, thank you.
No one's ever said I was charming before.

212
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:51,754
They've said, "Rimmer, you're a total git,"
but never charming, no.

213
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,434
- Well, I think you're very charming.
- Really?

214
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,551
Very, VERY charming.

215
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,797
Well, thank you. Um...thank you.

216
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:04,635
I'd just better go
and see how er... Kryten's getting on.

217
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,598
Excusez-moi.

218
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,038
- She's quite something, isn't she, sir?
- She's enchanting.

219
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,390
- You think so?
- She's got everything -

220
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,710
style, taste, poise...

221
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,238
- She's absolutely lovely.
- Oh, I'm so glad you think so, sir.

222
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,831
I don't mind telling you, I think
there's some romance in the air.

223
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,958
You sly old dog, Krytie! I think you're right.

224
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,519
Sure, her nose is a little loose, but to me that's just cute.

225
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:46,753
I'll tell you something. She's so like
my sister-in-law Janine, it's untrue.

226
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,316
Camille looks like your sister-in-law?
What happened?

227
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,835
Was she involved in some
kind of horrific car accident?

228
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,914
Who, Janine? No, of course not, she was a model.

229
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:02,079
- And she looked like Camille?
- Absolutely. The resemblance is uncanny.

230
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,193
What did she model? Spark plugs?

231
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,113
- I happen to think she's very attractive.
- You do?!

232
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,834
- Certainly.
- Do you think I'm attractive?

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,994
You? Of course not. I think you look like
a giant half-chewed rubber-tipped pencil.

234
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,115
Well... well you can think what the heck you like,

235
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:24,877
because there are some people in this big old wide
cosmos, who happen to think I'm pretty amazing-looking,

236
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,920
especially in the eye department,
I thank you so very much.

237
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,450
You're back. I heard.

238
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,678
- Ah, sir, you haven't met our visitor, Camille.
- Hi.

239
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,235
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'll go and prepare your quarters.

240
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,631
The penthouse suite on A Deck should suffice.

241
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:58,153
Yeah, well, this looks fine. If you just like to
remove your clothes, we'll begin the examination.

242
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,310
Sorry. Dave Lister, ship's surgeon.

243
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,954
- You're a surgeon?
- Well, I'm not fully qualified,

244
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,956
but I've seen every episode of "St Elsewhere".

245
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,335
Still, if it makes you feel
uncomfortable, y'know,

246
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,938
we can completely dispense
with the physical examination

247
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:13,955
and go straight for the malpractice.

248
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,678
So just lie back, relax, and I'll go turn on the laughing gas.

249
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,673
What do you want, giggles or
guffaws? It's all the same to me.

250
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,156
Something tells me you're not really a doctor.

251
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,474
What gave it away? The fact that I've gone
fully ten seconds without patronising you?

252
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:34,670
This is weird, y'know. The last two human beings in an
infinite cosmos and we happen to bump into each other?

253
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,999
- Yeah, it is weird, isn't it?
- And you realise we have an awesome responsibility?

254
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,271
- We do?
- Yeah. Sure we do.

255
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,398
We gotta rebuild the human race...
as quickly as possible.

256
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:48,309
Do you wanna start now or do
you want to clean your teeth first?

257
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,197
And they say romance is dead.

258
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,951
Hey, the prospect of making love to a complete and
total stranger is just as galling to me, yknow?

259
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,154
We've got to be completely professional
about this, totally clinical and unemotional.

260
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,790
So just lie back, relax, and I'll go
slip into my Spiderman costume.

261
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,919
Ah, Listy. I see you've met our ravishing guest.

262
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,550
- Camille, have you seen Kryten?
- He went up to the penthouse suite on A Deck.

263
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,751
Thanks muchly.

264
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,199
Oh, Camille... It's just a silly thought, really,

265
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,672
but I thought perhaps after you've settled in and you're
feeling up to it, we could pop up to the projection room

266
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,556
and I could talk you through my photo
collection of 20th-century telegraph poles.

267
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,394
Yeah, or if you fancy a slightly
more entertaining evening,

268
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,514
you can just let him take you outside
and shoot you through the head.

269
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:40,157
As it happens, Listy, Camille is into
telegraph poles every bit as much as I am,

270
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,876
especially the 1952 Phase IVs
with the triple-reinforced wire.

271
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,351
- What? You're into telegraph poles?
- Of course not.

272
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,269
You see? What did I tell you.
And she's also a big fan of Reggie Wilson.

273
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:55,155
- What? You like Hammond organ music?!
- It's mindless pap.

274
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,352
Absolutely amazing, eh?
Reggie Wilson, telegraph poles...

275
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,875
It's uncanny how much we've got in common.

276
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,515
- Are you OK, Rimmer?
- Never better.

277
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:07,071
Where is he, A Deck? Ciao for now.

278
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,915
- What was all that about?
- What about?

279
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:17,398
You know, you were saying one thing and Rimmer
was hearing another. How do you do that?

280
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:20,874
Well, you'd probably
have worked it out eventually.

281
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,031
I'm a Pleasure GELF.

282
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,430
Hey, what's going on, buddy?

283
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:38,838
Eraserhead tells me she's a mechanoid
and Captain Sadness makes out she's a hologram.

284
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,839
Well, she's both of those and neither of those.
She's a GELF.

285
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,395
- GELF?
- Yeah. A Genetically Engineered Life Form.

286
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:48,155
She's a Pleasure GELF,
created to be everyone's perfect companion.

287
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,190
Everyone who looks at her perceives her differently. You see
what you wanna see, guy, what you most desire.

288
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,836
Are you telling me if I go into
that room, I'll see my perfect mate?

289
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,834
Mmm, yeah,
and she'll fall instantly in love with you.

290
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,595
What exquisite treasure of loveliness
lies behind those doors?

291
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:10,551
Well, knowing you, a 6ft Valkyrie warrior maiden
in scanty armour with a cleavage you could ski down.

292
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,757
Stop. You're making me dribble.

293
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,991
Well, here goes.

294
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,598
Hi, buddy.

295
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,790
- You're me.
- Who else?

296
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,039
- I'm the object of my own desire?
- Can you think of anyone more deserving?

297
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:36,838
Well, if you put it like that,
I guess you're right. Damn my vanity!

298
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,594
(BOTH) Ooow!

299
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,791
- What did you see?
- Oh, just some gorgeous chunk of loveliness.

300
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,634
- Come on, what did you see?
- Ooh, what a body!

301
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:51,440
- What did you see?!
- My legs are still shaking.

302
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,719
- Cat, what did you see?!!
- Someone get me a brandy!

303
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,231
Well, I should've guessed.
It was all a mighty bit too strange.

304
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,190
I mean. actually meeting someone who didn't want to
vomit all over me in complete loathing and disgust.

305
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,320
I shouldn't take it so personally,
sir. It's the same for all of us.

306
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,235
We all been made to feel foolish,
used, chewed up and spat out.

307
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:20,479
Look, she didn't mean us any harm.
She can't control how we see her.

308
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,956
She's...a mirror for our obsessions.

- I didn't see anything. I don't think I've got any desires.

Either that, or me screen was foggy.

311
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,679
I guess I owe you all an apology.

312
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:38,554
Sorry, Dave.

313
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,115
Sorry, Duke.

314

- Sorry, buddy.
- Heartbreaker!

315
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,751
I told you it wouldn't work, Kryten,
if there were others.

316
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,078
You're the one who's hurt the most.
You're not used to these emotions.

317
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,636
Why did you lie to me?

318
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,753
Because I felt something really special for you. Something I'd never felt before.

319
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,117
I knew if you saw me as I really was, you'd be repelled.

320
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,118
Well, try me.

321

I'll change to what I really am.

- This is what I really look like.
- Oh.

00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:26,915
- What do you think?
- Well, I think you look... really nice.

326
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:32,709
Nice? She looks like something
that dropped out of the Sphinx's nose!

327
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:37,393
He's right. I'm just a huge green blob.

328
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,991
True, but as huge green blobs go,
I think you're really cute.

329
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,669
- I don't believe you.
- OK, so you're never going to get on the cover of 'Vogue',

330
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,956
but, hey, neither am I.

331
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,634
- I think you're really sweet.
- You're lying.

332
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,919
- I can't lie. I'm a mechanoid.
- You really don't think I'm repulsive?

333
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,000
Of course not.
There's some humans not as attractive as you.

Camille, I'd be really grateful if
you would join me for dinner tonight.

337
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:14,196
- You mean that?
- Parrot's Bar on G-Deck. I'll meet you there at eight.

338
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:17,516
Flats or heels?

339
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,759
I can't believe he's really going through with this.

340
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,036
Look, if Kryten wants to take an amorphous
green blob for a discreet téte-a-tentacle,

341
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,714
- I say good luck to him.
- I mean, me too.

differently don't we?

When Steve McQueen
met the Blob, he tried to kill it.

344
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,432
it probably never crossed his
mind to try and take it out to a restaurant.

345
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,599
I have a great idea. They should go to a sushi bar.

346
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:50,071
At least that way, the food won't look better than his date.

347
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,272
Sir. I respect your sense
of dress more than anything,

348
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,717
and I'd really appreciate your opinion of this outfit.

349
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:02,750
Kryten, if I was going out with a large
ball of green slime, that's how I'd dress.

350
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,269
Thank you, sir. That means a lot to me. Well...

visitor down in the hangar. He wants to see Camille.

I was going to tell you, Kryten. Truly I was.

- We're both blobs, Kryten.

00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:43,150
I left him a long time ago.
I thought he'd given up looking.

- I guess.

- I'm going to tell him I met someone else.

I'm going to tell him I'm staying here with you.

Mr Lister sir, would you be so kind as to take Camille's bag on board?

378
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,878
- Certainly, Kryten. Anything you say.
- Why my bag, Kryten?

379
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,232
Because you're getting on that
craft with Hector where you belong.

- No, Kryten.
- Now you've got to listen to me

Do you have any idea what you've
got to look forward to if you stay here?

382

- We both know you belong to Hector.
