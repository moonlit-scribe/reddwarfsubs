00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,760
("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,670
Ten o'clock changeover. Anything to report?

3
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,595
We're still lagging behind Red Dwarf, sir,
almost 24 hours behind, now.

4
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,235
Other than that, it's been a moderately quiet shift,

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,998
except for one small shock a couple of hours ago when we
noticed an alien invasion fleet off the starboard bow.

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,513
Thankfully, it turned out to be one of Mr Lister's
old sneezes that had congealed on the radar screen.

7
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,479
- How are we fuel-wise?
- Unchanged for today, sir.

8
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,951
However, the supply situation
grows increasingly bleak.

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,193
We've recycled the water so often,
it's beginning to taste like Dutch lager.

10
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:16,997
- We're OK for food though, aren't we?
- Confidentially, sir, no.

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,913
We've no meat, no pulse and hardly any grain.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,473
Worse still, the only Liquorice Allsorts left are those
only little black twisty ones that everybody hates.

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,996
If that weren't bad enough, space weevils
have eaten the last of the corn supply.

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,191
So what's under the grill?

15
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,391
Space weevil.

16
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,595
You can't serve space weevil, Kryten.

17
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,597
I mean, not even Lister with his single remaining
taste bud will knowingly sit down and eat insectoid vermin.

18
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:48,195
Well, let's face it, it's practically cannibalism.

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,553
But it's incredibly nutritious, sir.
After all, it is corn-fed.

20
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,672
- You'll never get him to eat it.
- Trust me, sir. They say "the first bite is with the eye"

21
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,275
It's all down to presentation.

22
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,914
Et voila!

23
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,440
- Changeover. Anything new?
- Nothing much.

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,912
Electrical storm, alien war fleet -
false alarm - the usual stuff.

25
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,439
Look at the state of this place!
Why can't you ever clean up before we swap over?

26
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:21,679
What the hell is all this down
the back of my chair? Peanuts?

27
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,315
No, I've been trimming my verrucas.

28
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,669
You have personal habits
that would make a monkey blush!

29
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:35,351
You really think I'm psychotically
disgusting, don't you? They're peanuts, OK?

30
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,716
- Real peanuts?
- Yeah.

31
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:37,830
Where'd you get them?

32
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,735
Derelict a couple of months back.
I found them in the dead captain's old donkey jacket.

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,113
Don't look at me like that!
You enjoyed that mint imperial, didn't you?

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,433
- And where did you get that?
- He was sucking that when he got shot.

35
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,830
I had to prise his jaws
open with a car-jack.

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,879
You think I'll buy
anything you say, don't you?

37
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:00,634
Well, wrong, buddy! Now get outta here.

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,638
I gotta keep my eyes skinned for that asteroid shaped
like a dancing moose you told me about yesterday.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,834
- Hi, honey, I'm home.
- Supper, sir, and tonight's movie.

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,550
I'm sorry, sir, it is another Doug McClure.
Please don't hit me.

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,592
- What's this?
- Sir?

42
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,472
Raw carrot?

43
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,954
Kryten, you know
how I feel about fresh vegetables.

44
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,637
They're for health psychos, vitamin freaks,
people... who exercise.

45
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,511
I'm sorry, sir.

46
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,434
- Is everything OK, sir?
- No, it's not.

47
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,833
Some smegger's filled in
this "Have you got a good memory?" quiz.

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,116
But that was you, sir, last week. Don't you remember?

49
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,911
- Was it?
- Mmm. Look.

50
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,879
Nobody else spells "Thursday" with an "F".

51
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,718
I can't help it. I went to art college.

52
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,066
How's supper, Listy?

53
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,670
It's delicious. Didn't think we
had any crunchy king prawn left.

54
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,954
I hate to go all technical on you, but all hands on deck, swirly thing alert!

55
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,711
- Where?
- It's not on the radar yet, but I can smell it.

56
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,150
- Nothing here.
- Nothing on long range.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,553
Sir, is it possible
you could have made a mis-smelling?

58
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,758
Listen, butter pat head,

59
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,194
my nostril hairs are vibrating faster than
the springs on a Spaniard's honeymoon bed!

60
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,175
I'm telling you,
something's out there!

61
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,515
Don't get your double-helix in a strict.
No one's questioning your nasal integrity.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,880
- Go to Blue Alert.
- What for? There's no one to alert. We're all here.

63
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,156
I would just feel more comfortable ifI know we're all
on our toes because everyone's aware it's a Blue Alert situation.

64
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,514
- We all ARE on our toes.
- May I remind you about Space Core Directive 34124?

65
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:05,160
34124 - "No officer with false teeth
should attempt oral sex in zero gravity."

66
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,950
Damn you both all the way to Hades.
I want to go to Blue Alert!

67
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,117
OK, OK.

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,429
Thank you. A bit of professionalism.

69
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,750
Wait! I've got something. I'm punching it up.

70
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,516
Too small for a vessel. Maybe some kind of missile?

71
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,267
It's impossible to
tell at this range.

72
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,396
Whatever it is, they clearly have a
technology way in advance of our own.

73
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,230
So do the Albanian State
Washing Machine Company.

74
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,392
- Step up to Red Alert!
- Sir, are you absolutely sure?

75
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,712
It does mean changing the bulb.

76
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:46,316
There's always some excuse, isn't there?

77
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:49,433
Range 15,000 gigooks and closing.

78
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,598
- Direct collision course. Suggest evasive action.
- Engaging re-heat.

79
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,239
It's still with us!
It's some kind of heat-seeker we can't outrun it.

80
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,796
That's it. We're deader than tank tops.

81
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,919
Suggestions?

82
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,516
Sir, may I recommend I load myself
into the reverse-thrust tubes

83
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,240
and you use my body as decoy fodder.

84
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,917
This of course will leave me splattered across deep space
and unable to complete today's laundry,

85
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,754
for which I apologise in advance.

86
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,639
Kryten, stop your blathering
and get in the damn tube.

87
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,831
Kryten, sit down.

88
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,594
I'm not doing me own smeggin' ironing.

89
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,797
Look, maybe we can reason with it.
Open communication channels, Lister.

90
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:38,195
Broadcast on all known frequencies,
and in all known languages, including Welsh.

91
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,517
This is acting senior officer Arnold J Rimmer

92
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,799
of the Jupiter Mining Corporation
transport vehicle Starbug.

93
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,237
Now hear this, 'cause it's only coming once.

94
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,950
We surrender, totally and without condition.
Thank you for listening.

95
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:59,398
Oh, additional. Sorry to take up
your valuable time. Sorry. Thank you, sorry. Bye.

96
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,870
Bye. Sorry. Thank you. Bye.

97
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,200
Rimmer, you've got a longer yellow streak
than a stampede of diuretic camels.

98
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:12,911
Know this about me - like General
George S Patton, I believe in reincarnation.

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,995
It is my firm conviction that
in all my previous lives I've been a soldier,

100
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,839
a bold warrior soul, who tragically in this incarnation
has been given the body of an abject coward.

101
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:32,111
So excuse me, gentlemen, while I have a humiliating
panic attack under the scanner table.

102
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,959
- Here it comes!
- Five gigooks to impact.

103
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,157
Hang on to your wage packets!

104
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,351
The controls are down!

105
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,354
- What on lo was that?
- Some kind of suction beam. We're being dragged down.

106
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,551
- Fire up the retros.
- Dead.

107
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,279
- Auxiliary power?
- Dead.

108
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,113
- Joystick?
- Dead.

109
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,558
The entire panel's deader
than flares with pockets in the knees!

110
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,960
I've located the beam's source. I'm punching it up.

111
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,856
So, what have we got?

112
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,299
Well, it seems we were snared by some
kind of malfunctioning guidance beam

113
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:26,616
designed to help
docking supply ships.

114
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,473
- We've shut it down and we're free to leave.
- Anyone around?

115
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,196
- No life signs. Nothing.
- The ident computer is stubborn as a mule.

116
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,910
All I could get from it's pesky little ROM was
something about classified military research.

117
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,550
Wouldn't give me any details, but
listen to some of physicists involved -

118
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:45,794
Heidegger, Davro, Holder, Quayle -
some of the most brilliant minds of the 23rd century.

119
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,351
Whatever they were cooking up here, it
must have been something pretty special.

120
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,830
- Anything we can salvage?
- There must be something we can swipe.

121
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:57,390
Well, gentlemen, our strategy is clear.
Let's tool up and go shopping.

122
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,358
- What? Anything?
- I'm not sure. Something.

123
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,319
It's almost off my nasal spectrum.

124
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,396
(WHOOSH)

125
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,879
- (RAPID BLEEPING)
- Strange. A life reading.

126
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,031
Why didn't it register before?

127
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,312
(URBANE VOICE) Welcome, my friends. It has been
many centuries since I last had visitors.

128
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,710
You, of course, are Kryten.

129
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,118
And you are Rimmer, the hologram. May I?

130
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,879
Now then... Yes, of course.

131
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,636
Primitive.

132
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,076
So basic.

133
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:05,280
You'd better have a mighty damn fine
explanation for what you've just done, m'laddio.

134
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,554
Forgive me. I merely converted your
projection unit from soft light to hard light.

135
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,159
Hard light?

136
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:19,832
I've got a body? I can touch? Feel?

137
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,032
Puncture repair kit on standby, sir.

138
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,313
- But how?
- I created the hard light drive years ago.

139
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,757
My mind is not all that it once was.

140
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,634
- You, my friend, are Lister.
- How come you know who we are?

141
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,834
- You are in pain. Here.
- Nah, just a bit of Bangalore belly.

142
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,715
No. It is something more serious. May I?

143
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,359
OK.

144
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,955
Your appendix.

145
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,829
As I thought,
you were on the verge of peritonitis.

146
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,591
Cheers, man.

147
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,591
- And you are the Cat.
- You come anywhere near me, buddy

148
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,912
you'll be wearing them bowels
as a bobble hat.

149
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,956
You're all tired and in need
of nourishment. Come, let us dine.

150
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,915
- What is your name?
- Call me... Legion.

151
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,032
- (CHAMBER MUSIC)
- Please, make yourselves comfortable.

152
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,039
Legion, these statues,
you sculpted them yourself?

153
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,675
Years ago. I was... a different person then.

154
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:37,239
According to my connoisseur chip, they fulfil
all ten requirements for being masterpieces.

155
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:41,189
- You have a connoisseur chip?
- Just because I look like Herman Munster's stunt man

156
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,431
doesn't mean to say I can't appreciate art, sir.

157
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:48,874
- I shall return with the feast.
- Can I eat? I mean, in this body, is it possible?

158
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,795
Mr Rimmer, in a hard light body,
you can do anything a human can do,

159
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,190
with the added bonus that
you are practically indestructible.

160
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,716
I can't be hurt?!

161
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,831
Your pleasure and pain responses remain
the same, but you cannot come to harm.

162
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,798
Excuse me.

163
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,229
His cellular structure is unique - genetic strands I've
never seen before - part living tissue, part mechanical.

164
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,638
We've got to persuade him to come with us.
He'd get us back to Earth in weeks!

165
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,670
And what a team we'd make. Legion, with his
scientific genius, intellect, culture and sophistication,

166
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,719
and us with... with...

167
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,673
With our Red Alert bulb.

168
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,755
Let's flag down a black cab and head for Real Street here.
This Johnny won't come with us.

169
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,110
He'd never fit in. Can you see him joining in our late night sessions of "Pin The Pointy Stick On The Weather Girl"?

170
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,917
True, but once he's signed up and we're off in the big
black, it'll be too late for him to change his mind.

171
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,153
All we have to do is create the facade that
we're not the uncouth morons you are.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,233
Here is the feast. It is a traditional
24th-century Mimosian banquet.

173
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:57,149
How absolutely divine, Le-gion.
Although I must say,

174
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:02,394
our souls are already gorged, fit to burst
with the feast of art laid out on your walls.

175
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,194
I wasn't aware you have an interest in art, Mr Rimmer?

176
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:09,261
Many's the night we while away the
wee hours contemplating a Caravaggio.

177
00:13:09,285 --> 00:13:11,510
Discussing it's shape,
themes and form.

178
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,280
The pointy-stick game doesn't get a look-in anymore.

179
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:19,714
Marvellous! Now, this three-dimensional
sculpture in particular is quite exquisite.

180
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:22,190
Its simplicity, its bold, stark lines.

181
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,432
- Pray, what do you call it?
- The light switch.

182
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,675
- The light switch.
- Yes.

183
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:31,229
- I couldn't buy it, then?
- Not really.

184
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,080
I need it to turn the lights on and off.

185
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:39,753
It's a pity, because if it wasn't a light switch,
in many ways it could be considered a masterpiece.

186
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:44,958
Kryten, please join us. Mimosian cuisine
is quite acceptable for mechanoids.

187
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:50,069
Indeed. It has long been a dream of mine
to sample its unique flavours.

188
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,709
Let the meal begin.

189
00:13:54,960 --> 00:14:00,512
I'm sorry. Of course. Not all of you
can use Mimosian anti-matter chopsticks.

190
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,580
I'm fully versed, Legion.

191
00:14:02,604 --> 00:14:08,209
For my cooking duties, I'm programmed to be
proficient in all known off-world eating techniques,

192
00:14:08,233 --> 00:14:13,118
including Jovian boogle hoops, and the
often-lethal Mercurian boomerang spoon.

193
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:17,075
- But the others...
- Anti-matter chopsticks?

194
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:22,758
- We use 'em all the time.
- Can't even remember what a fork looks like.

195
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,554
Don't let a few congealed custard
stains down Lister's long johns

196
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,189
delude you into thinking
we're not sophisticated.

197
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,360
The trick is, of course, to never,
ever, under any circumstances,

198
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:45,399
to allow live sticks to touch.

199
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,279
But, of course, we all know that.

200
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,632
- Well, bon appetite. Tuck in, Listy.
- No, no. After you, man.

201
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,791
Wouldn't hear of it.

202
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:29,033
Sir, you're creating a reverse field, try and
keep the electron flow in the same direction.

203
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:32,195
How do you land the damn stuff?

204
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,194
Simply invert the ionic phase
in the downpulse of the field margin.

205
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,994
I was with you all the way up to "simply".

206
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,191
Like so.

207
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:53,518
Sir, the glass is fixed to the table.
It's Mimosian telekinetic wine.

208
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,753
- So, how do you drink it?
- You simply will the liquid into your mouth,

209
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,753
and then you telepathically
decide on its flavour. Thusly...

210
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,998
Ah! Delicious.

211
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:13,193
Kryten, help me!

212
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,636
- Cat, that's mine!
- I can't help it, bud!

213
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,270
- Somehow we've crossed wavelengths!
- It feels like you're pulling my teeth out!

214
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,353
- Try swallowing it!
- I have! Three times!

215
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,840
My friends, I sense you are trying
to impress me. There really is no need.

216
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,276
Legion, may I be frank?

217
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:45,119
It's not often we meet an individual who we feel
could improve our already pretty damn fine top-notch team.

218
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:51,913
But in you, we feel we have. In all our travels,
we've met precisely 31 individuals. Three. One.

219
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:56,358
and we've never felt moved
to invite a single one to join our crew.

220
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:00,639
True, most of them wanted in
someway to suck out our brains

221
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,838
or erase us from history altogether.

222
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,676
But, nevertheless, they still weren't
what we would consider the right stuff.

223
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:12,470
We feel that you are different. We feel that you, like us,

224
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,271
have the courage and the dignity
it takes to make it as a Dwarfer.

225
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,151
Sir! Don't cross the chopsticks!

226
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:32,314
Mr Rimmer, I am moved
by the eloquence of your invitation,

227
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,678
but it is quite impossible for me
to leave the confines of the Institute.

228
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:41,789
- It was Lister, wasn't it? He put you off.
- Is there nothing we can do to change your mind?

229
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,311
- Absolutely.
- Then I'm afraid, we must bid you farewell.

230
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,313
- We have a long journey ahead of us.
- Nonsense!

231
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,596
You have no journey at all, my friends.

232
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:54,913
I insist you stay with me
you will be my honoured guests,

233
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,799
from now until the day you die.

234
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,959
Thirty-two.

235
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,393
- This will be your cell, Dave.
- My cell

236
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,473
You really are a nutter, aren't you?

237
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:15,032
Sugar Puff sandwiches, me favourite?

238
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,635
I think you will find nothing here that isn't to your liking.

239
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:21,873
The entire room is stocked for your own
unique personal tastes and requirements.

240
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:26,079
Two dozen eight-packs
and a spare pair of sneakers in the icebox.

241
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:30,757
- Faultless. Not an inch wasted.
- All your favourite music, all your favorite movies.

242
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,275
Absolutely no Doug McClure.

243
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,871
- You will want for nothing.
- Nothing? What about company? What about people?

244
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,631
There is a cyberpark in the complex.
You may go to any time period of your choosing.

245
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,839
and indulge any fantasy you wish
with any persons you desire.

246
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:51,954
And that's in some way
supposed to make me happy?

247
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,351
S-Sorry, run that by me one more time?

248
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,479
You will meet your companions in the morning.

249
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:05,238
(SLOWLY) Now, you must excuse me.
They are falling asleep. I must go.

250
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,070
(FLAT CHORD)

251
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,356
Amazing. Doesn't even need tuning.

252
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,834
(CLASSICAL MUSIC)

253
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,156
- Good morning, sir.
- What does he want from us?

254
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,358
Why is he so obsessed with fulfilling our every desires?

255
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:28,912
We're all equally baffled, sir.
Was your room like everyone else's? Perfect in every detail?

256
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:34,035
Impeccable. Right down to the overstarched
pyjamas and nocturnal boxing gloves.

257
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:38,433
- What about you?
- Filthy walls, mud-streaked floors, mop and bucket...

258
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,591
I was in hog's heaven, sir!

259
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,754
When I finally get round to writing my "Good
Psycho Guide", this place is gonna get raves.

260
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,434
Accommodation, excellent. Food, first-class.

261
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:51,114
Resident nutter, courteous and considerate.

262
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,875
Psycho rating's gotta be
four and a half chainsaws. Highly recommended.

263
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,879
Sirs, we must not be seduced by all this fine living.

264
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,112
However munificent our captor,
we are still prisoners.

265
00:20:01,136 --> 00:20:04,716
And with every second that passes
we lose yet more ground on Red Dwarf.

266
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,474
You're right, Kryt. Cat, caviar niblet.

267
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,076
Buck's Fizz.
Let's talk about how to get out of this hellhole?

268
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:16,471
What do we know about this johnny? And
why is he so keen on keeping us happy?

269
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,367
Is it possible that our well-being
is in some way linked to his own?

270
00:20:19,391 --> 00:20:21,669
What, you mean, like he's
feeding off our emotions?

271
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,157
Remember when we arrived,
the scans recorded no life signs.

272
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,433
Is it possible that our very presence here
has, in some way, inadvertently awoken him?

273
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:33,713
Wait a minute. I think I've got a way
of getting out of here.

274
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,589
Has anyone ever seen "Revenge of the Surfboarding
Killer Bikini Vampire Girls"?

275
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,350
I think that one slipped us by, sir.

276
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,968
Well, there's this one scene,

277
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,238
where the good-looking, unconventional female
journalist, who wore glasses and a tight sweater,

278
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:51,156
was trapped, deep in the bosom of the surfboarding
killer bikini vampire girls' lair

279
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:54,278
and she came up with this truly
award-winning escape plan.

280
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:00,598
Ah, Legion. We have considered our position

281
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,350
and decided our best option is
to make a new life here with you.

282
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,591
You truly believed I'd be deceived
by that schlock plan

283
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,719
from "Revenge of the Surfboarding
Killer Bikini Vampire Girls"?!

284
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,669
(GUTTURAL ROAR)

285
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,238
I just want you to be happy.

286
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,194
(ROARS)
Now look what you made me do.

287
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,679
- What the hell are you, buddy?
- Kryten knows.

288
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,951
- I do?
- You suspect the truth.

289
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,924
You mean you
are a gestalt entity?

290
00:21:38,948 --> 00:21:43,509
Not a single creature, but a combination
of individuals melded together to form one?

291
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,280
My name is Legion, for we are many.

292
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:50,876
What? You're us? ALL four of us?

293
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:54,710
Our combined minds
and personalities, blended together?

294
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,594
Oh, much more than that,
exponentially more.

295
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,230
The whole becomes far greater
than the sum of its parts.

296
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:06,833
So we can't leave because you're us?
You're created from us - If we leave, you cease to be.

297
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:10,999
Without you, my friends,
I am quite literally nothing.

298
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,795
So if he's us, he can't hurt us, right?

299
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:20,246
Wrong.

300
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,910
But this is insane. Hurting us is
hurting yourself. Our pain is your pain.

301
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:28,432
Kryten, you forget. Not only do I possess
your combined intellects and memories,

302
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,357
I also share the sum of your malice
and rage and anger, magnified many times.

303
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,151
I'm capable of quite insanely
irrational behaviour. Watch.

304
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,716
(ALL WAIL IN PAIN)

305
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:47,357
The next hint of insurrection,
and the scalpel ends up... here.

306
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,439
Legion, that kind of tough talk doesn't scare us.

307
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,876
(OTHERS) Yes, it does!

308
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,317
But what about the sculptures and
the masterpieces and the technology?

309
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:59,438
- Where does that come from?
- My first incarnation.

310
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,798
I was host to the five most brilliant minds of their generation.

311
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:07,511
They were experimenting in collective intelligence.
I was the product of that research.

312
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,104
Heidegger, Quayle and the others?
The composite of their genius?

313
00:23:11,128 --> 00:23:13,272
Your mind must have
been extraordinary!

314
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:19,556
But all too soon, old age began to kill them,
and as each one died, I became less,

315
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,519
until I was nothing, just a mindless essence,

316
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:28,437
swirling around the remnants
of my achievements, waiting to exist again.

317
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,359
- There's just one thing still baffles me.
- What's that?

318
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,758
- Everything.
- Sir, permission to test a supposition?

319
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,110
- Granted.
- Trust me, sir.

320
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,510
- What's going down here?
- The gestalt requires our consciousness in order to exist.

321
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:51,754
Therefore, as each of us becomes unconscious, his power
diminishes. Permission to 'lay you out', sir?

322
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,038
- Do what you gotta, but don't mess up my hair.
- Thank you.

323
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,711
Kryten, there has to be
a more escape plan than this.

324
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:04,111
- Sir, come back, you're just delaying the inevitable.
- I can't help it, I'm allergic to being hit.

325
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:09,958
You won't feel a thing. I'll render you
unconscious using the lonian Nerve Grip.

326
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,431
That's not an Ionian Nerve Grip. That's
smashing me over the head with a vase!

327
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,720
There's no such thing as an lonian Nerve
Grip. Now stand still while I hit you!

328
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,512
Your hard light drive's tougher
than vindalooed mutton!

329
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,440
- This'll do the trick.
- You can't be serious?!

330
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:32,630
Harder! Harder! Harder!

331
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:38,318
Stop! Stop, stop. For God's sake! If you want a job
doing properly, do it yourself!

332
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,872
Stop!

333
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,797
Stop, Kryten! Clearly, this is not working. I'm a hard light
hologram and as such, un-knockoutable.

334
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,190
- I think you're right, sir.
- Kryten!

335
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,069
- Sorry, sir, I just thought that if I took you unawares...
- Kryten!

336
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,949
I'm trying to think,
you rubber-headed eunuch!

337
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:04,069
- Right, got it. Turn off my light bee.
- I can't sir. I can't penetrate hard light.

338
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,596
You'll have to extract it yourself.

339
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:13,078
- Now we are even.
- I am merely you. Stalemate.

340
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,673
Not so. Since the only ingredients in your
psyche are mine, you are now incapable of malice.

341
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,798
And because a human life takes precedence over the life of any mechanical,

342
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:25,590
you are in fact compelled
to assist our safe passage to Starbug.

343
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,952
As long as the others remain unconscious,
your logic is impeccable.

344
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,276
(GROANS)

345
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,551
(CLUNK)

346
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,993
- You take the Cat, I'll take Mr Lister.
- In many ways, I'm relieved.

347
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,318
To have shared their psyches, their
neuroses, their strange drives,

348
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,791
returning to a limbo state of non-existence
seems like promotion.

349
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,717
One last thing, in your original incarnation,
when you were composed of all those great minds,

350
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:54,830
 did you ever develop anything
which might assist our pursuit of Red Dwarf?

351
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,392
Here we go. Initiating ignition sequence.

352
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:07,712
- Is this gonna work?
- I see no reason why not, sir.

353
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,271
All tests bear out it is indeed
a fully functional stardrive.

354
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,155
If we've linked it correctly to
the 'Bug's existing engines,

355
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:17,356
we'll be able to catch up with Red
Dwarf in a matter of nanoseconds!

356
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,074
- Yeah, but it's bound to go wrong, isn't it?
- Sir?

357
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,959
- It always does for us, every time.
- He's right!

358
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,317
There isn't a dog in hell's chance
this stardrive is actually going to work.

359
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:30,686
Sirs, haven't we learned over the
past two days that if we all pull together,

360
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:33,392
we can become greater
than the sum of our parts,

361
00:26:33,416 --> 00:26:37,474
that if we are of one mind and one intent,
there are no boundaries to what we can achieve?

362
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:41,873
This stardrive is going work. Do we believe?

363
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,789
- (THEY MUMBLE) We believe.
- (FIRMLY) Do. We. Believe?

364
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,395
We believe!

365
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,669
(HISSING)

366
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:15,416
(HOWLING WIND)

367
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,319
- Well, we know one thing, sir!
- What's that?

368
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,517
It does work!

369
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,277
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

370
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,671
# I'm all alone, more or less

371
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:33,037
# Let me fly far away from here

372
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,840
# Fun, fun, fun

373
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,550
# In the sun, sun, sun

374
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,111
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

375
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:46,398
# Drinking fresh mango juice

376
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,791
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

377
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,600
# Fun, fun, fun

378
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:56,515
# In the sun, sun, sun

379
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,274
# Fun, fun, fun

380
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:03,513
# In the sun, sun, sun #
