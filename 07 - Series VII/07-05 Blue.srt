1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,399
("RED DWARF" THEME)

2
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:43,436
Good morning, sir.
How about a little breakfast?

3
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,673
What would you say to a dozen grilled
winkles on a bed of curried Rice Krispies?

4
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,229
I'm not eating that spicy stuff any more.

5
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,429
Forgive me, sir, but the phenomena you not eating
spicy food is like a zebra not being stripy

6
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,594
or an old lady not sitting
on a park bench with her legs open.

7
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,957
- May I ask why?
- Well apart from anything else, it makes your breath smell

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,511
like a liftful of senile donkeys
returning from a garlic-eating contest.

9
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,078
- Well, that's never bothered you before, sir.
- Well, it bothers me now, OK?

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,114
It's because of her, isn't it?
She who must be drooled over.

11
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,789
- You mean Kris?
- Whatever my feelings, sir,

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:22,318
I will not be tempted into making
petty criticisms of fellow crew members.

13
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,915
There is of course the issue of the salad cream...

14
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,919
- The salad cream?
- I spent many months training everyone

15
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,151
to put the salad cream in the fridge.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,676
Then she comes on board and - lo and
behold - it turns up back in the cupboard!

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,475
The first moon we come to, let's dump her!

18
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:42,711
And what about the extra laundry?

19
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,236
Now there are all kinds of extraordinary
items turning up in the dirty linen basket -

20
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,994
tights, bras, skimpy vests, little socks.

21
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,754
It's a massive extra workload. Frank is very upset.

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,066
- Frank?
- The washing machine.

23
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,311
I named him Frank, he
works better with an identity.

24
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:59,030
And what about the ironing?
I mean, how do you iron a bra?

25
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,874
Well, you gotta take it off first.
I spent years practising that.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,999
I used to put my nan's bra around the armchair
until I could unhook it with me left hand.

27
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:09,676
Even now, everytime I see
a Parker Knoll, I get horny.

28
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,280
But have you ever tried to ironed a bra, sir?

29
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,475
The only way I've found is to stretch each
container over my head and iron it from there.

30
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,032
Believe me, on a hot cotton setting, it sends
my optical systems into leak overload.

31
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,191
- Cup.
- Sorry, sir?

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,638
- They're not called containers. They're called cups.
- Oh, you see? I even have to learn new terminology.

33
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,795
Special female terminology -
"cups", "potpourri", "depilatory cream".

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:39,954
- Oh! It's never-ending.
- How come you don't know what bras are?

35
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:44,273
- What about the women on the Nova 5?
- Well, when I cleaned out my cache files, sir,

36
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,431
I erased my lingerie database.

37
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:51,515
I didn't see there'd be much call for it unless we had a fancy dress party and you wanted to go as Hermann Goering.

38
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,000
Anyway you can relax, Kryten.

39
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,949
She programmed the scan probe last week and it's
returned the coordinates of the dimensional tear.

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,192
This time tomorrow,
she'll be back in her own dimension.

41
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,476
Well, you're surely not upset, sir?

42
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,938
Look, if you've got a problem
with her, say something to her.

43
00:03:04,962 --> 00:03:05,951
Well, I think I will!

44
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:09,715
There's no point whinging
to me about it, say it to her!

45
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,117
- Hi, guys. How's it going?
- Ah, morning, Miss Kochanski ma'am! Sleep well?

46
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,957
- Coward.
- Hypocrite.

47
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,031
Erm, not great, actually.

48
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,433
I had this weird dream about a monkey
being stretched across a tennis court.

49
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,876
The noise was just unbearable.

50
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,516
Were you practising
the guitar again last night?

51
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,839
So, what's for breakfast?
Oh, what's this doing in here?

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,114
Hold me back! Hold me back!

53
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,154
Don't you see, sir? These deviations from established
Space Corps drill could put our lives in jeopardy.

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,914
She was only drying her tights
on the radiator!

55
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:07,313
That's the thin edge of the wedge,
sir, one day it's drying tights, the next,

56
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,835
we're spiralling out of control into the core of a newly-formed sun!

57
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,480
Er, sorry to interrupt, but we've got a couple of problems.

58
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,559
- All the hazard approach lights are flashing.
- All of them?

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,913
Yes, although on this ship, that can mean anything from
"we're under attack", to "the baked potatoes are burning".

60
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,519
Either way, it's serious.

61
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,157
Getting a reading.
There's something up ahead.

62
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,517
A shiny thing with a long silvery,
glimmery thing behind it.

63
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,360
It's a phasing comet, velocity 25,000 MPS.

64
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,676
- That's what I said!
- Kryten?

65
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,914
How am I supposed to concentrate on a phasing comet when as soon as my back's turned the salad cream gets warm?

66
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,316
Heading straight for its tail. Plotting avoidance course.

67
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,989
What's the problem with going
through it? It'll get you home quicker

68
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,511
Last time anyone did that,
the gyroscopic forces ripped the ship apart,

69
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,149
turning the crew into the
consistency of potato salad.

70
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,036
Is that the firm delicatessen board potato
salad or the squishy, gooey stuff in tins?

71
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,756
- Tins.
- Maybe we should go around.

72
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,397
We'll make it. We're a good crew.
We've been through a few things.

73
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,256
- Remember we met up with the Vidal Beast of Sharmutt 2?
- The one that nearly killed us?

74
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,756
- No, the other one! Look, we can make it, OK?
- Do you know what a comet is made of?!

75
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:19,042
- Are you suggesting that I don't know a comet's made of?
- (KRIS) Yes.

76
00:05:19,066 --> 00:05:20,722
- Well I do.
- So what's it made of?

77
00:05:20,746 --> 00:05:22,276
- (LISTER) What's it made of?
- Yes.

78
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,797
- You wanna know what it's made of?
- (KRIS) Yes, I do.

79
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,145
- Ma'am, he knows what it's made of.
- What?

80
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:27,949
Sir, tell her, for
goodness sake.

81
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,236
- (MOUTHS)
- (KRIS) So. What's it made of?

82
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,758
- I see, I see. Gas. Some kind of gas.
- Some kind of gas?!

83
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,276
Yeah, some gas! Dunno what it's called.
Some gassy type of gas.

84
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,554
- It's made of ice.
- Exactly. An icy type of gas. That's what I said. Ice. An ice gas.

85
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:48,914
I hate to interrupt, but this thing whatever the
hell it is, is gonna hit us in about 45 seconds.

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
I was only trying to save time so we
could get to the dimensional tear quicker

87
00:05:52,424 --> 00:05:54,593
and you could get home
to your much better Lister.

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,714
And I'm just trying to prevent us from being scattered
all over the galaxy like some kind of cosmic seasoning!

89
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,594
- Here it comes!
- That wasn't 45 seconds!

90
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,509
Oh, sorry! I was reading the baked potato
timer by mistake!

91
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,029
Will people not leave it in here? It just makes us
look like we don't know what the hell we're doing!

92
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,910
Lateral trimmers not responding!
Like wrestling in treacle...

93
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,158
You hear that? Cat says the
trimmers are like wrestling in treacle!

94
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:30,514
No, I said they were down, then asked
if you like wrestling in... It can wait...

95
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,952
- Damage report, Kryten.
- Auxiliary flight modulator's short-circuited.

96
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,552
And the chocolate dispenser's ejected
all the Nuttyfruit snack bars onto the galley floor!

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:47,278
- What's happened to the stabilisers?
- Never mind the stabilisers! Where's the hair mousse?

98
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:50,871
- Stabilisers very unstable.
- Nuttyfruit bars sliding about!

99
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,196
I'm taking over control!

100
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,791
Hey! What did I tell you?

101
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,396
Come to Daddy, baby! I have control.

102
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,871
It's called a free-fall vacuum.
We're in between vapour streams.

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,395
With a bit of luck we can ride it
across to the other side of its tail.

104
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,591
(CRASH)

105
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,194
Or maybe not!

106
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:14,392
If we don't turn around and go back,
we'll disintegrate in two minutes!

107
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,551
- Kryten?
- That's a little pessimistic, sir.

108
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,910
I'd say more like three!

109
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:22,439
You know what, I think we should turn round.

110
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,553
Phew!

111
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,911
- Well, go on. Say it.
- Say what?

112
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,587
You know what
you wanna say. Say it.

113
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:38,662
- You want me to say it?
- Say it.

114
00:07:38,686 --> 00:07:40,074
You really want me to say it?

115
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,639
- Go on, say it.
- All right.

116
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:46,431
- My Dave would never have endangered our crew like that.
- You had to say it, didn't you?

117
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,479
And will you stop calling
your boyfriend "Dave"? I'm Dave.

118
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:54,669
He's just an alternative version of me from
a parallel dimension. He's not Dave, he's the anti-Lister.

119
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:57,400
Well, whoever the hell he is,
I'm not going to get to see him.

120
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,633
By the time we fix this mess,
I'll have missed the linkway!

121
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,633
I could've got through that
if the thrusters had worked.

122
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,191
According to the syscomp, the thrusters never
worked because we're carrying too much weight.

123
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,512
It's Miss Kochanski's laundry.
Why will no one listen to me?

124
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,189
Those little frilly things
are heavier than they look.

125
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,234
Suppose we take a look in the cargo hold
and see what supplies can be jettisoned.

126
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,439
I'll go. I could do
with a breath of musty, fetid air.

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:27,595
Sir, you didn't deliberately damage the ship
so that Miss Kochanski had to stay behind, did you?

128
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,634
No! Of course not!
Look, I'm gonna check out the hold.

129
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,791
Rimmer, man, you coming?

130
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,680
Did I say...?

131
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,271
Why did I call you Rimmer?
I called you Rimmer, my God!

132
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,070
Cat! Are you gonna make yourself useful or
are you just gonna preen yourself all day?

133
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:48,039
- You mean I have a choice?
- Come on.

134
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,669
I can't believe I called you Rimmer.

135
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,279
Yes?

136
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:04,838
As it seems you may be with us for some time, ma'am, I was
wondering if I might go through a few 'rules of the ship'?

137
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,957
- Like what?
- Salad cream.

138
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,192
Salad cream belongs
in the fridge and not in the cupboard.

139
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,837
Two - pants belong in the pants drawer
and socks belong in the socks drawer.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,406
Having discovered a
sock in your pants drawer,

141
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:19,836
this simple principle
obviously needs restating.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,037
Talking of my clothes,

143
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,909
I'd like you to explain why my bras come back
from the laundry shaped like...like...

144
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,760
..your head?

145
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,271
- Three - the toilet seat fiasco...
- Kryten, I just don't want to hear this!

146
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:36,439
Mr Lister hasn't said anything,
but I can tell he's not happy.

147
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,674
Well, he's not the only one! Do you think I like
flying round space in this big skip with thrusters?

148
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,520
Do you think I even enjoy breathing in on this ship?!

149
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,038
And to cap it all I am faced with some neurotic droid
who's completely obsessed with my pants drawer!

150
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,470
You mean I'm not alone?

151
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,553
Oh, I see. You mean me.

152
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,755
Well just as long as we understand one another!

153
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,510
God! Welcome to hell.

154
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:07,474
Look at these. Rimmer's old shoe trees.
He had one for every pair of his shoes.

155
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,316
He gave them all names -
Monshoetree, Tueshoetree, Wedshoetree.

156
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:17,400
- What the hell for?
- So they all spent the same amount of time in his shoes.

157
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:20,791
- What a smeg-head.
- You know, he had lots of funny little habits.

158
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:24,351
- But now that he's gone I can see them for what they were.
- Cretinous.

159
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,556
No. Little human foibles that made
Rimmer... special. He was unique.

160
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,990
Yeah, irritating, awkward and unsightly -

161
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,959
he was the human equivalent of a visible panty line!

162
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,913
Well, we may as well start somewhere.

163
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,480
- These can go!
- No, no, you can't throw them out.

164
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:47,838
They're from when me and Rimmer
played golf on Traga 16. We had a lot of fun.

165
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,839
You had fun with Rimmer?

166
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,550
I'm afraid I only had room to build a nine-hole course, sir.
It is a very small planetoid.

167
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:59,639
Taking into consideration
the thinness of atmosphere, sir,

168
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:03,430
I've made this a 15-mile hole, par three.

169
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,476
Oh, good shot, sir!

170
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,199
(LISTER) Hey, watch this. Watch and weep.

171
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,595
- Oh, smeg!
- Ooh, I... I think it's gone into orbit, sir.

172
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:29,709
Tough luck, Listy. I'll just pot mine
and you owe me 50 big ones!

173
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,837
Look at him. In the right boots,
he could be marching into Poland.

174
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,912
Hey.

175
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,197
- It's Rimmer's ball, isn't it?
- It must have gone right around the planetoid, sir.

176
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,672
Heey, no point bothering him
about it, Krytie. Let's go.

177
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:53,154
It must be here somewhere.
I've been round the planetoid twice.

178
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,156
No ball, no bet, man. Keep looking.

179
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,909
Memories like that
are just too precious to throw away.

180
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,394
Hello there, sir. How's it going?

181
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,279
We're getting nowhere, bud.
He won't throw any of his stuff

182
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,273
away because it reminds him
of good times he had with Rimmer!

183
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,093
I must have blinked
and missed them.

184
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,674
You don't know what we used to do
back on Red Dwarf in the early days,

185
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,797
like when we played the locker room game.

186
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,995
We used to open up the lockers of all the dead
crew members and we got to keep whatever we found.

187
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,119
I don't trust you, Lister.
This game's rigged. Everytime we play it, you win.

188
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,476
Last time, you got a 30 carat gold wristwatch,

189
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:37,396
and all I got was one wellington boot and a box
of 100 assorted tampons that glow in the dark.

190
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,038
- Right, well, I'll go first this time.
- OK.

191
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,239
- No, you can go first.
- OK, I'll have 68.

192
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,913
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!

193
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,913
- I'll have 68.
- Fine.

194
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,515
Uh... No, you can have it.

195
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,079
Why?

196
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:00,359
I know you've chosen that one because
you think that I think that you're cheating.

197
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,194
So I'll have it, and it'll be useless.

198
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,512
I'm not going to fall for that one, Listy. You can have it.

199
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:08,671
Too smart for me, man.

200
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,798
Hey, a gold necklace...

201
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,076
a bundle of cash...

202
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,596
and - hey! - a nude wrestling video!

203
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,719
"Baked Bean Bombshells Volume 12".

204
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,633
Right, well, I'll have that one.

205
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,919
- Number 58.
- OK.

206
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,031
What the hell was that?

207
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,669
There's a note.

208
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,759
"People who break into lockers
deserve everything they get,

209
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,038
"you cheap double-crossing slimeball."

210
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,311
Sounds like they know you.

211
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:01,153
See, we had fun. It
was great. It was fun.

212
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,509
I'll put the rubber room on standby, sir.

213
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,837
About time, Cat.
You're late, man. Where've you been?

214
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,636
Hello, Listy.

215
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,033
Rimmer! Smeggin' hell!
What are you doing here?

216
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,392
I got fed up with adventuring.
You know what it's like,

217
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,190
you save a couple of civilisations,
and it all gets a bit... samey.

218
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:40,117
- I thought I'd come and find the old team.
- It's good to see you. Are you real?

219
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,233
I'm as real as you can get, being a hologram.

220
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:50,470
- So.. where've you been?
- Argon 5.

221
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,553
I fought in the Belagosian War.
I was decorated...

222
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:58,635
and used as a Christmas tree in the town square where people
came and fed me cherry liqueur chocolates for the whole winter.

223
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:00,399
Really?

224
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,753
No, I'm only kidding.

225
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:05,031
Kidding? What do you know about kidding?

226
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,153
I just thought it was time I lightened up a bit.

227
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,797
Hey-hey!

228
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:16,989
Ahem...
So, er, what about you? How's it going?

229
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:22,354
Ah, y'know. Same old Starbug.
Same old travelling through space.

230
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:29,199
I, um... I hear you've got a new crew member?

231
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,391
Yeah, Kochanski.

232
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,951
What's she like?

233
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:38,839
Oh, she's OK, y'know...

234
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,599
Is she... as good as me?

235
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,913
Well, she's been here a few weeks and she
hasn't quoted one Space Corps Directive.

236
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,070
She's pretty attractive though, isn't she?

237
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:59,069
Is she? I hadn't really noticed.
She's the type you don't really notice.

238
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:03,711
You know when you eat soup and you spill some on
your shirt and you don't notice it? She's like that.

239
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,879
So she's... not as attractive as me, then?

240
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:12,472
Don't be daft.
She couldn't hold a candle to you, man.

241
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,035
- Nah, you're just saying that.
- No, I'm not.

242
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:19,476
I've, um... I missed you, man.

243
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:23,950
And I've missed you, too, Listy.

244
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,873
- Oh, Arnold, man.
- Dave!

245
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,635
- Don't ever leave us again!
- I won't, I won't!

246
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,360
- You promise?
- Oh, Listy!

247
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,919
Oh, Rimsy!

248
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,639
Yaaaaarrrggh!

249
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,598
No! Oh my God! Get off! Get off!

250
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,190
Oh, it was just a dream.
Thank God for that! Just a dream.

251
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,751
(INAUDIBLE)

252
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:04,674
...and another thing she does is,
she keeps her pants in her sock drawer.

253
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,515
Have you any idea how time
consuming that can be to sort out?

254
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,115
You mean you've seen her pants?

255
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,829
You're right, Kryten, I must be losing it
or I'd never be dreaming stuff like that.

256
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,756
Kissing Rimmer? I'd rather go bobbing for
apples in a communal latrine at the Reading Festival!

257
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,994
I'm sure this will help, sir.
I'll just insert my hypnotherapy disc.

258
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,511
Now, just relax.

259
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,954
(SHOUTS IN GERMAN)

260
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,755
- What the hell...?!
- Sorry, sir. Wrong disk.

261
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,840
That was my German language course.
An extract from Hitler's Nuremberg speech.

262
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:56,637
Definitely hypnotic, but not in the right way.
I'll just go and find the proper one.

263
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,397
- What are you doing in here?
- Just looking for something

264
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:11,030
to erase the memory
of everything I've ever experienced.

265
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,750
A couple of gallons
of medicinal alcohol should do it.

266
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:19,318
Listen, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry you missed getting back to Dave...

267
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,993
the hologrammatic hunk.

268
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,909
That's OK. I'm sure there'll be another
chance for you to cock it up again.

269
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:29,512
- I suppose you must be missing him?
- Yeah, I am a bit.

270
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,059
- I know what it's like to miss someone - the way they talk...
- Yeah...

271
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,750
the way they laugh...

272
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,076
- I know.
- The way their nostrils flare up

273
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,676
like two railway tunnels
leading into Snot Street Station.

274
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,871
No... you've lost me there.

275
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,511
So you're missing Rimmer?

276
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,439
I had a dream about him, but he was different,

277
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,389
all smiles and jokes and... and stuff.

278
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,671
I thought you guys didn't get on?

279
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,077
We didn't, that's what's so weird.
His tidiness drove me crazy.

280
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,153
The way he used to eat his food in alphabetical order,

281
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,394
the way he only ever used three pieces of toilet
paper - one up, one down and one to polish.

282
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,631
- Didn't he have any redeeming features?
- No.

283
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,236
Well, yeah - sometimes
he went out of the room.

284
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,954
So, how come Rimmer came to be around, anyway?

285
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:23,234
Well, Holly brought him back to keep me sane,
but he drove me mad!

286
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,832
So, now he's gone, maybe you feel guilty
because you realise he was trying to help you.

287
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,431
If he was trying to help me,
why didn't he lighten up a bit? Be happy?

288
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,439
Maybe he sacrificed his
happiness to keep you sane?

289
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,997
But when he appeared in your dream, he was
different, a carefree, fun-Loving Rimmer.

290
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,154
A Rimmer who didn't nag you into helping him
catalogue his cheese collection.

291
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,911
- You're saying I had him all wrong?
- It wasn't your fault.

292
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,879
You had to hate him. It was what kept you going.

293
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:53,951
I didn't know.

294
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,758
(PARPS)

295
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,996
You know what I should do? I should throw
everything away and make a new start.

296
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,469
Ah, sorry, Miss Kochanski, ma'am.

297
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,433
This is the medical bay, for sick people only.

298
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:22,275
Surely you haven't broken out
in a confusingly-filed-pants rash?

299
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,270
Kryten, do you know how to extract a warm bottle of
salad cream from a mechanoid's rectal cavity?

300
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:32,156
- Not off hand ma'am, but I could research it.
- I'd start right now if I were you.

301
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:38,318
- OK, sir, now. Just relax.
- It's all right, Kryten.

302
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,596
I talked things through with Kochanski.

303
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,400
- I feel a lot better.
- Well, that really takes the biscuit, doesn't it.

304
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,076
I turn my back for five minutes
and she waltzes in here and cures you!

305
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,750
- She was only trying to help.
- It's not the help I mind, sir.

306
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:53,150
It's the fact that she succeeded.

307
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,151
(PARPS)

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,913
OK, guys!
I now declare Games Night officially open.

309
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,351
Seeing as Kris is with us, you can have
the honour of choosing the first game.

310
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:11,680
And as you're a bit sensitive, we're not going to have any
games that involve dropping trousers and lighting stuff.

311
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,958
Well, that takes care of most of the repertoire!
Where's Kryten?

312
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,795
I dunno, he should be here.
OK, Kris... name your game.

313
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:22,038
All right! I choose "The Magic Flute"!

314
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:27,551
- What's that? Sort of musical chairs?
- No, it's an opera.

315
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,037
"The Magic Flute"?
OK, we each hum a section of an aria,

316
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,430
and the others have to guess
which character is singing.

317
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,871
- That's a game?
- It sounds more like medieval torture.

318
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:43,232
No, it's really good because you
can, like, throw each other off the scent.

319
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:49,555
Once Dave, my Dave, he sang "The Birdcatcher's Song"
in the German translation and it was hilarious!

320
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,155
- We all like totally fell about!
- You fell about?

321
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,113
- Yeah!
- Were you going through a meteor storm?

322
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,396
So what games do you play, then?
Match the body part to the crew member?

323
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,159
I always love that one!

324
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,309
'Armpit Name That Tune'? 'Guess Whose Botty
Is Sticking Through A Hole In The Curtain'?

325
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:11,672
Shall I add that one to the slate, bud?

326
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,314
Games Night is cancelled.
If you'll all kindly follow me to the AR suite,

327
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,949
I have something I think might amuse.

328
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,598
(BLEEPING)

329
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:32,878
I believe this is the answer
to your dream, sir.

330
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:36,874
And something slightly more effective
than Miss Kochanski's psychobabble.

331
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,274
It's a museum to Mr Rimmer's memory.
I made it myself.

332
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:52,910
If anyone find they're missing him,
they can relive those great moments.

333
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:56,391
It's all in there -
the man, the memories, the personality.

334
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:59,154
- The ego.
- Yes, I had to scale that down quite a bit.

335
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:03,951
- How did you compile all the exhibits?
- Well, I recreated key events in his life from Mr Rimmer's diaries

336
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,909
He kept meticulous records
of life on board ship. Enjoy!

337
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:22,200
Welcome to The Rimmer Experience,

338
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,758
a place of wonder, excitement and... wonder.

339
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,634
You are about to witness some heroic events

340
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:33,475
which you may well find impossible
to attribute to any living person,

341
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,634
but then Arnold J Rimmer
was a deeply remarkable man.

342
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,679
Being the driving force
behind the Red Dwarf mission,

343
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,276
the fearless Rimmer had to
dice with death on a daily basis.

344
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,919
What?!

345
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,432
Sometimes, it needed a strong mind
and cool nerves to hold the crew together.

346
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,311
Asteroid belt up ahead, sir.

347
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,319
No, it isn't, Kryten,
you thick titanium plank.

348
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,872
Those are large broken fragments of a dying star which
have compressed together under enormous pressure,

349
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,270
causing them to compress
into large fragments.

350
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,678
You're quite right, sir... as usual. How could I
have made such an elementary mistake... as usual!

351
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,794
- It's at times like these that I get really scared!
- Me too!

352
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,194
Save us! Somebody save us before I wet me keks!

353
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,869
That never happened!
I swear that never happened!

354
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,754
- I feel sick!
- I'm sorry, sir, it is a bit bumpy.

355
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,389
Nah, it's what I'm seeing that's making me sick!

356
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:36,194
So you see, Cat? If you wear the green paisley shirt
with cavalry twill trousers,

357
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,079
you can be dignified and
fashionable at the same time.

358
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,520
Let me at him! I'm gonna kill him!

359
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,911
Cavalry twill? What does he think I am?
A woodwork teacher?

360
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:50,595
Say, Rimmer's a really great guy, isn't he?
I don't know what we'd do without him?

361
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,910
I owe my life to him.

362
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,511
- I can't stand this, get me out of here!
- Wait a minute. Here comes the best bit.

363
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,800
(MUSIC STARTS)

364
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,118
# If you're in trouble he will save the day

365
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,312
# He's brave and he's fearless come what may

366
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,836
# Without him the mission would go astray

367
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,311
# He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer

368
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,791
# Without him life would be much grimmer

369
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,237
# He's handsome, trim and no one's slimmer

370
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,870
# He will never need a Zimmer

371
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,357
# He's Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer

372
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,717
# More reliable than a garden strimmer

373
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:35,236
# He's never been mistaken for Yul Brynner

374
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,836
# He's not bald and his head doesn't glimmer

375
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,472
# Master of the wit and the repartee

376
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,718
# His command of Space Directives is uncanny

377
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,510
# How come he's such a genius? Don't ask me

378
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,872
# Ask Arnold, Arnold, Arnold Rimmer

379
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:56,317
# He's also a fantastic swimmer

380
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,313
# And if you play your cards right

381
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,678
# Then he just might come round
for dinner... #

382
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,312
I never wanna see or hear
from that scum-sucking, lying,

383
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,598
weasel-minded smegger in my entire life!

384
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,360
Sigmund Freud, eat your heart out!

385
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,279
# It's cold outside,
there's no kind of atmosphere

386
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,717
# I'm all alone, more or less

387
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:31,032
# Let me fly far away from here

388
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,840
# Fun, fun, fun

389
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,630
# In the sun, sun, sun

390
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:41,077
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

391
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:44,358
# Drinking fresh mango juice

392
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,717
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

393
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,474
# Fun, fun, fun

394
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,270
# In the sun, sun, sun

395
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,239
# Fun, fun, fun

396
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,553
# In the sun, sun, sun #
