- Arnold!
- I'm here, Mother!

4
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,469
You know your father and I have been terribly
worried about your progress at school.

5
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,647
Yes, Mother.

6
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:07,594
You just haven't been getting
the marks we think you're capable of.

7
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:09,120
No, Mother.

8
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:11,675
Well, a few days ago I went to see the headmaster.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,246
He said it might be in your best interest
if you were to be kept down a year,

10
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,552
if you were to stay in
Junior D for another year.

11
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,394
- Oh.
- Is that all you've got to say?

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,714
Well, it is quite difficult to talk
when you're tied upside down to a tree.

13
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,633
- Have you been playing with Howard and Frank?
- Yes.

14
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,076
Well, what on earth were you playing?

15
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,314
Well, I said it was a such a shame we haven't
got a swing. Then they said they could make one.

16
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:40,678
I didn't realise
they was going to make one out of me.

17
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,557
Well, that's nice, darling. Anyway,
your father had a word with the headmaster,

18
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,794
and we explained how much we wanted you to be a test
pilot in the Space Corps like your brother John,

19
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,514
and how this could damage your chances.

We got this this morning.
You realise how important this is?

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,800

- Bless you, Spanners, old friend. It's good to be home.
- Well, how'd she behave?

How you and your boys down in engineering got that crate
to break the light barrier, I'll never know.

27
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,273
Well, some people might say it's the devilishly
brave and handsome guy in the cockpit that did it.

It's you and your guys with the magic
wrenches down in engineering, Spanners.

You're the ones who
break the records.

00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,117
- Not sure. why?
- Because, if you're interested,

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,910
I'll be in my quarters, covered in maple syrup.

53
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,356
I'm sorry, Mellie, I don't fraternise with the staff.

- I resign.
- I'll be there at 1300.

- 'Fraid so.

57
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,952
- You wanted to see me, Bongo?
- Ever heard of a thing called the 'dimension theory of reality'?

58
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,796
Doesn't that run along the lines that there is an infinite
number of parallel universes where every possibility exists?

59
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,278
It's along those lines, yeah. The basic tenet
states that for every decision that's made,

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,353
the alternative decision
is played out in another reality.

61
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,796
So?

62
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,551
So, the lab boys have come up with a
drive that can break the speed of reality.

- It's a one-way ticket, Ace

- There's no coming back.
- I'm free at 1500.

66
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,436
You do realise that this is a prototype.
There's no way of knowing if it'll even get there.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,797
- Where is 'there', exactly?
- You'll be transported to an alternative reality,

68
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,554
a reality where there's another Arnold Rimmer.

69
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,317
Some decision was made at some point in your life
where he went one way and you went the other.

70
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,269

- Sounds like quite a caper.

00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,750
You'll do it?

72
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,630
I'm a test pilot in the Space Corps, Bongo.
It's my job to do it.

73
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,798
I know this probably won't interest you, but er, I'd hate myself
for the rest of my life if I didn't at least suggest it...

74
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,799
- Suggest what?
- If you're interested,

It isn't. It's been happily married for 35 years.
It's just a chap like you can turn a guy's head.

Would it make any difference
if it was... hoummos?

00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,430
I'm sorry, Bongo. I'm strictly butter side up.

81
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,989
Understood.

- All systems check.

Hey, what are you doing with the lights on?
Come on, let's get out of here before...

98
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,352
- I don't believe it. All three of you.
- What's he talking about?

99

We didn't WANT to go without you.
We just thought it wasn't your scene.

00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,874
I mean, fishing. Well, it's boring, isn't it?

108
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,551
I love fishing! The glow of the dawn,
the line arcing into the water...

109
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,639
That's it, that's exactly the reason
we didn't invite you. There's no fish.

110
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,357
That, at least, is true, sir. We sent down a search
probe and there's no marine life on the entire planet.

111
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,157
We're just gonna sit out on Starbug, dangle the rods
over the side and have a few cans, you know. Chill out.

112
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,069
I don't believe anybody who would want to go on a
fishing holiday where they know there's no fish.

113

We used to do it all the time back home.
We used to go down the canal. Never any fish in that.

We used to go condom fishing.

I swear, one time I caught
this two-pound black ribbed nobbler!

116
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,991
It was about that big!

117
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,110
Why didn't you just say, "Dear Rimmer, we're going
on a fishing holiday and don't want you to come"?

118
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,432
- See? That's what I said we should say!
- Shh!

All my life it's been the same old story.

look in that mirror and see a guy nobody likes.

We gotta look at it all day!

treasurer of the Hammond Organ Owners' Society.

I offer to talk you through my photo collection
of 20th-century telegraph poles.

You've always got some excuse.
None of you like Morris dancing.

128
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,950
Would that break your hearts, every once in a while,

129
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:28,069
the four of us getting our knees in the air,
the jingle of bells, the clonk of wood on wood?

130
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,880
You know, every time I
suggest it, you all pretend to be ill.

131
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,151
You've got it wrong, man.
We just thought you wouldn't want to come.

132
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,153
Now we know you do, great, you can come.

133
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,269
The way you're going about it. It's like there's some major
conspiracy we've been planning it for days. We haven't.

134
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,033
- Really?
- Really.

135
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:48,190
All right, then. I'll come. I'll just get dressed, Holly?

136
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,755
Oh, who woke him up?

137
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,710
- (RIMMER) Steady now, Kryten.
- (KRYTEN) Yes, sir.

138
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,197
Best to get there in one piece than to rush it and cause an accident, eh?

139
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,786
- I have passed my test, sir. I am a fully qualified pilot.
- Mind that star!

140
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:11,390
That star is over two light years away, sir.
We're nowhere near it.

141
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,754
There's no percentage in being a boy racer, Kryten.
OK, you passed your test but... Mind that planet!

142
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,997
- Which planet?
- That planet!

143
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:22,118
That's the planet we're heading to, sir.

144
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,038
Excellent. Excellent. Plot an orbital course.
We'll be there in no time.

145
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,029
- Yes, sir. I have done, sir.
- Yes, and get the second stage under way.

146
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,246
I already have done, sir.

147
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,313
But you haven't correlated the data
with the main computer banks, have you?

148
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,360
- Yes, sir. I have, sir.
- You know... you know your trouble, Kryten?

149
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,359
- What, sir?
- You're a git.

150
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,311
Stupid...
Three weeks stuck with Captain Yawn.

151
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,434
Look, it wasn't my fault. I could have sweet-talked our
way out of it if you hadn't have blown the whole gaff.

152
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,870
Me? What did I do? You're the one who woke him up!

153
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,995
I could've sweet-talked my way out of it, but, oh no,
but you had to come blundering in with your size 12s.

154
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,155
You are so two-faced. Why haven't you got the
guts just to tell the dude nobody likes him.

155
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:05,557
Oh, yeah. Great. Brilliant.
What am I supposed to say? "Excuse me, Rimmer.

156
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:09,759
"Do you know you're about as popular as a horny dog
at a Miss Lovely Legs competition"?

157
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,349
Well, that's what I'd do. I'd say...

158
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,080
Hi, buddy! How's it goin'?

159
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,676
Oh... I just had to get out of there. He's driving me nuts!

160
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,832
I cannot stand front-seat drivers.

161
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,470
Well, come on. There's not a lot going on in here.
We're on holiday! Let's cheer things up a bit.

162
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,077
How about some music?
I've brought my Hammond CDs with me.

163
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,359
How about "Reggie Wilson
Plays The Lift Music Classics"?

164
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,831
What about "Sounds
Of The Supermarket: 20 Shopping Greats"?

165
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,473
Has anyone seen the keys to the medical cabinet?

166
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,669
I feel a sudden urge to suffocate myself
with a two-pound black ribbed nobbler.

167
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,519
- Not Reggie Wilson please, Rimmer?
- You don't like Reggie Wilson? What?!

168
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,672
Not even "Pop Goes Delius"
or "Funking Up Wagner"?

169
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,551
I prefer something slightly more melodious,

170
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,157
like the long, drawn out death rattle of a man
suffering from terminal flatulence.

171
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,873
Come on, you bores. Let's do something.
How about we all sing some campfire songs?

172
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,350
# Kumbaya, my Lord

173
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,875
# Kumbaya... # Everyone. Kryten.

174
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,350
# Kumbaya, Kum... #

175
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,916
- Purple alert! Purple alert!
- What's a purple alert?

176
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,464
Well, it's sorta like not as bad as a red alert,
but a bit worse than a blue alert.

177
00:12:24,488 --> 00:12:26,354
Kind of like a mauve alert. Well, I say mauve-

178
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,394
Holly, wipe the rabid foam
from your chin and start again.

179
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,793
There's some sort of disruption
to the time-fabric continuum.

180
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,474
At least, I presume that's what it is.
It's certainly got all the signs.

181
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,349
There's this big wibbly-wobbly swirly
thing and it's headed straight towards us.

182
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,716
What is it?

183
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,271
I don't know, sir. Which ever
way I manoeuvre it follows us!

184
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,229
It seems to be locked in on us. Wait. There's something's coming out of it.

185
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:51,034
It's going to hit us! Collision course!

186
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,513
(KRYTEN) Emergency! Emergency!
Adopt crash procedure!

187
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,155
- Where's the card. Who's got the card?
- What card?

188
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,920
The plastic card. The plastic card,
with cartoons of the crash procedure on it!

189
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,589
- Rimmer, don't panic, man!
- It should be in the netting behind the seats.

190
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:08,515
Haven't we got to sit behind a woman
clutching a baby? What's the drill?

191
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,472
- Look, I know what it is.
- What?

192
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,957
Sit down, tuck your head between your legs
and brace yourself.

193
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:19,433
- Now what?
- Then you open the in-flight magazine and start reading.

194
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,599
The dullness of the articles act as a sedative.
I mean, look at this contents list -

195
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,071
"Salt - An Epicure's Delight",
"Classic Wines Of Estonia",

196
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,834
"Flemish Weaving The Traditional Way"...

197
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,753
Don't fight it, man. Let it take you.

198
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:36,476
How can you be so mind-bogglingly flippant? Don't you
know what's going to happen? We're going to crash!

199
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:41,550
Look, you've got to stay calm. It's a well-known fact the
more relaxed you are, the less likely you are to be injured.

200
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,149
Good luck, everybody. Here it comes!

201
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,871
(CLATTER)

202
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,196
"The Ancient Egyptians were great believers in salt..."

203
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,997
"When most people think of classic wines,
they are unlikely to consider the Estonian reds,

204
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:59,313
yet Estonian grapes
are among the fruitiest and most subtle..."

205
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:02,353
"Since the beginning of the 13th century,
Belgium has been the home

206
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:06,559
of some of the most remarkable weaving
to come out of North-west Europe..."

207
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,555
- Is everyone all right?
- Yes, thank God. I'm fine.

208
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,558
Cat!

209
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,473
It's bad, buddy. It's real bad.

210
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:40,917
See what I mean?
Red with apricot. I look like a jerk!

211
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,640
I'm bleeding an unfashionable colour!

212
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,192
If I'd known I was going to get my leg crushed,
I'd have worn white. It goes with anything.

213
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,397
- Is anything broken?
- Yeah.

214
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,200
All the stitching's come away
and the lining's ripped.

215
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,556
Somebody, please! Get me a tailor!

216
00:14:55,720 --> 00:15:00,954
Kryten, get the first aid box. We have to clean
this up, make sure he doesn't get gangrene.

217
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,589
Gangrene? You think I might get gangrene?

218
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,229
- Yeah. Shh!
- Hey, that might work!

219
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,040
Green with apricot - I think I could pull that off!

220
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,033
It's a break, sir. Quite a bad one.

221
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,797
I'll going to have to snap the bone
back into line, and there's no anaesthetic.

222
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,389
Here. Read the in-flight magazine.

223
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,560
"Salt - An Epicure's Delight. The salt on a typ..."

224
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,639
- (CRUNCH)
- Oooh! My God!

225
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,354
- Did it hurt?
- No, I'm talking about the article.

226
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,716
Have you done my leg yet?

227
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,629
- Holly, what's the damage?
- It doesn't look good.

228
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,475
We've lost the port engine, the starboard engine's packed up, the fuel line's severed,

229
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,837
we're taking in water through the hull, we've lost the landing jets, half the electric's out,

230
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,190
and the elastic's snapped on the furry dice.

231
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:52,552
- What does that mean in real terms?
- Well, it means you've got a more tasteful cockpit,

232
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,918
but unless you fix that starboard engine in the next 40 minutes, we're going to start sinking.

233
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,178
Anything we can do?

234
00:15:58,202 --> 00:16:01,398
We can try and hire a dance band
and get it to play "Abide With Me"?

235
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,640
I'm going to have to go out there and fix the engine.

236
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,410
You don't know anything about engines!

237
00:16:06,434 --> 00:16:10,313
Besides, there's a 40-knot gale out there.
You'd have to be insane to even attempt it.

238
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,233
Only a fool or a hero would even consider it.

239
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,200
Bingo! Down there.
They've ditched into the drink.

240
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,716
- I'm bailing out, Computer!
- (FEMALE VOICE) But, Ace, it's a suicide mission!

241
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,713
I caused the smash, should apologise.
Only manners.

242
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:29,635
- Bring her around for another pass.
- Please Ace, don't go. I love you.

243
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:34,476
Stiff upper modem, old girl.
Smoke me a kipper - I'll be back for breakfast.

244
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:50,515
Name's Commander Rimmer.
Arnold Rimmer. Friends call me "Ace".

245
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,439
I've come from another dimension. Explain later.

246
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,792
But first of all, let's get you out of this pit.
What do they call you, matey?

247
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,834
- Uh... K-Kryten, sir.
- Series 4,000 Mechanoid, am I right?

248
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,719
Salt of the Space Corps.

249
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,553
- Spanners.
- Eh?

250
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,434
I'm sorry, you reminded me of a fellow I once knew.
What's your handle?

251
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,831
- Lister. Dave Lister.
- Of course it is. Put it there, Dave.

252
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,359
You look a great bloke to be in a scrape with.
What about the guy in the sharp suit?

253
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,511
He hasn't got a name, we just call him Cat.

254
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:22,469
Looks like you've bought yourself a broken
leg there, Cat. I love the Cuban heels.

255
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,069
Who's the deeply delicious,
stunningly gorgeous computer?

256
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,271
Holly.

257
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,280
God, it's me, only much more handsome.

258
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,155
Well, it looks like I'm superfluous.
Old Arnie'll have you out of here in no time!

259
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,355
- He's a hologram. He can't touch anything.
- Dead, eh? Well, Commiserations, old man.

260
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,712
- What a crushing bore that must be.
- You're me?

261
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:48,430
Don't quite understand the science, but it's got
something to do with us living identical lives

262
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,800
up until a certain point, where a decision was made
and you went one way, I went the other.

263
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,595
Still, can't hang around here chinwagging all day.
Let's get this box up into the air, shall we?

264
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,912
- What's your plan, Arn?
- I...haven't got one.

265
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,954
OK. Right. well, um...

266
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,239
I suggest this - the starboard engine is repairable,
but it's a two-man job. Any volunteers?

267
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,910
Yeah, OK. Count me in. I've got a window
in my schedule this afternoon.

268
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:17,636
Not so fast, Davey boy. You leapt in so quick, you didn't give Arnie here a chance to speak.

269
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,470
- He was just about to volunteer, weren't you, Arn?
- No, I wasn't.

270
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:25,434
OK, well, um... let's get cracking, shall we, Dave?

271
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,280
What's the starboard engine's
thrust-to-input ratio, Arn?

272
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,909
- What's that?
- Well, you can work it out.

273
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,550
- What's the craft's inertia rating?
- I don't know.

274
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,950
- Well, what's the PSI?
- I don't know!

275
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,836
OK, we'll work it out when we get there shall we? Come on, Dave.
Better grab a brolly. There's a bit of a drizzle outside.

276
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:48,791
- Sir, can I have a word in private?
- Of course, old friend. Excuse us.

277
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,509
- What's the prob, Kryters?
- Well, I have a limited understanding of medicine, sir.

278
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,913
but it's plainly obvious even to me
that your left arm is broken in several places.

279
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:06,316
Took a bit of a tumble in the landing. It's only a scratch.

280
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,990
I cannot allow you to go out in this storm, sir. Not with your arm in that condition.

281
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,040
- I must insist you allow me to go in your place.
- I see.

282
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,398
- The Series 4,000 isn't waterproof, is it?
- Well, that's besides the point, sir.

283
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,597
Look, I'll tell you what we'll do...

284
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,353
Sorry, old chum, no option.

285
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,315
Arnie, Kryten's taken a bit of a whack. I want you
to reroute his circuitry and bring him back on-line.

286
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:33,638
- How?
- You don't know how to do that?

287
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,274
No.

288
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,558
Come on, Dave. Let's catch a breath of fresh air.

289
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,991
Smoke me a kipper... Can you do that?

290
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,350
I'll be back for breakfast.

291
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,549
(WIND HOWLS)

292
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,320
- What's your favourite music, Dave?
- Eh?

293
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:07,196
Keeps your spirits up if you sing a song.

294
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,431
- I like Rastabilly Skank.
- Right.

295
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,478
Aaaah!

296
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,952
Grab my arm, Dave! Grab my arm!

297
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,995
'Fraid I'm going to have to do
something a bit sissy now - black out.

298
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,356
Sorry about that. Let's get cracking!

299
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,159
# Whether you like rastabilly... #
Go on, Dave! Sing that song!

300
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,510
# Whether you like rastabilly... #

301
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,318
Paisley with stripes... That's nice...

302
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,831
Green anoraks with furry collars... They're great!

303
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,838
Oh, sir! He's delirious!

304
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:56,559
Oh! Rubber trousers,
held down with bicycle clips... Wow!

305
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,196
"Commander Rimmer." I ask you.

306
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:06,311
"Ace." Barf city!
I bet you anything he wears women's underwear.

307
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:12,472
They're all the same, his type, y'know? - hurly-burly,
rough-and-tumble macho marines in public,

308
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,190
and behind closed doors,
he'll be parading up and down in taffeta ball gowns

309
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,715
drinking mint juleps, whipping the houseboy.

310
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:23,471
Sir, he's you! It's just that your lives
diverged at a certain point in time.

311
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,910
Yes, I went into the gents and he went the other way.

312
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:29,357
I assume sir, you are making
fatuous references to his sexuality.

313
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,114
- May I just point out...?
- Yes! We did it!

314
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,598
(BOTH CHANT) Awooga, awooga, awah, awah!
Awooga, awooga, awah!

315
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,519
What a team! How you got that housing clear, I'll never know.

316
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,792
Oh, come on, Ace, it was you! I could never have reconnected that fuel line.

317
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,573
Well I wouldn't have been able to do it
if you hadn't been holding me by the ankles.

318
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:49,520
How could you hang upside down AND fix the starboard engine. It was totally brutal.

319
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:51,484
- What a team!
- What a team.

320
00:21:51,508 --> 00:21:52,718
Now I know where I've seen you two.

321
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:57,073
Weren't you the double-action centrefold
in July's edition of "Big Boys In Boots"?

322
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:01,990
Now, look here, Arnie. You can say what you like about me,
but I won't hear a word against Skipper, here.

323
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,271
- "Skipper"?!
- Man like him deserves a nickname.

324
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:06,954
- I thought "Skipper" sat rather well.
- "Ace" and "Skipper"?!

325
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:11,358
You sound like a kids' TV series
about a boy and his bush kangaroo!

326
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:16,953
Don't listen to him, Skipper. Let's get this tea chest
up into the stars and back to the small rouge one, eh?

327
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:23,031
Yeah, the sooner we get back, the sooner you two can climb
into a nice hot soapy bath and play "spot the submarine".

328
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,911
Sir, the Cat -
I don't think he's going to last much longer!

329
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:37,394
Bri-nylon underwear... Sock suspenders...

330
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,155
- Suits with cardigans!
- Oh, Sir, he's delirious! His leg's all swollen.

331
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,119
- I think- I think he may lose it.
- (LISTER) Lose his leg?

332
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,511
I fear so. The operation to save it is beyond my expertise.

333
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:50,354
Lose my leg? Hey, that's terrible.

334
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,875
None of my suits will fit!

335
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,799
Kryten, I'll need 500ccs
of corticoadrenaline, two pints of plasma,

336
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:01,157
a laser scalpel and some kind of tissue sample, a Macro-Bollington will do.

337
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,271
Oh, my God.

338
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:08,475
Field microsurgery - all part of basic training
in the Space Corps Special Service. I'll go scrub up.

339
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,990
I'll go and throw up.

340
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,200
- How's the Cat?
- Oh, Ace did it.

341
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,035
Cat's fine now. He's just sitting up in bed
looking through some swatches,

342
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:25,158
trying to find a material he likes for his dressings.

343
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,315
I don't know how Ace does it. He's been on his feet
for 36 hours, he's still laughing and joking.

344
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,154
What a guy.

345
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:36,836
He's just nipped off to teach Kryten
how to play the piano. Amazing dude.

346
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,873
So, is it a simple registry office
or a full church do for you two?

347
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,196
I don't understand your attitude, Rimmer. He's you!

348
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:49,873
He's not me! I'm me! He's a me who had all the luck,
all the chances, all the breaks that I never got.

349
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,750
No, it was just a single incident, and your lives
went off in completely different directions.

350
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,193
It's incredible to think that one decision in your childhood
could produce such drastically different people.

351
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,230
Right. He probably got to go to some really great
school, while I was lumbered with lo House.

352
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,673
He got to meet all the right people,
greased his way up the old boy network,

353
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,874
towel-flicked his way into the Space Corps,
Masonic-handshook his way into flight school

354
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,879
and brown-tongued his way up the ranks.

355
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,864
You would think you'd be pleased that somewhere
in some other dimension there's another you.

356
00:24:19,888 --> 00:24:21,588
Another you doing really well for himself.

357
00:24:21,612 --> 00:24:24,751
Oh, come on, how would you feel if some git
arrived from another dimension,

358
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:30,279
another Lister, with wall-to-wall charisma
and a PhD in being handsome and wonderful?

359
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,074
Hey man, I AM that Lister!

360
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,436
No, come on. How would you feel if there was another
Lister doing a hell of a lot better than you are?

361
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:41,554
There IS. Ace knows him.
That's why he called me Spanners when he first came in.

362
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:44,280
In Ace's dimension, he's a flight engineer in the Space Corps

363
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:47,751
married to Kristine Kochanski,
twin boys, Jim and Bexley.

364
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:51,993
I'm made up for him.
Whatever he did that I didn't, he deserves the lot.

365
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:57,633
For me, it kinda makes sense of a load of stuff, to think
that in all these dimensions every possibility is played out.

366
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,680
Hell, there's probably a really, really weird dimension
where you're better-looking than me.

367
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:06,754
Well, it just makes me bitter. You know I've
always had this thing about not getting the breaks.

368
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,959
Well, there's living proof of what I could
have achieved if I got the one he got.

369
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:15,671
- (ACE) Skipper, got a mo?
- Go on. He's probably picked a ring.

370
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,920
Skipper, I've decided I'm not going to stay.

371
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:28,391
- Why?
- Him and me. It would never work.

372
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:33,760
I just can't stand to be near the man. To see myself so
warped, so bitter, so weaselly. The man's a maggot.

373
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,473
- So where are you going to go?
- Just out there.

374
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:40,951
I can't go back, but there's a
billion other realities to explore,

375
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,350
a billion other Arnold Rimmers to meet.

376
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,195
Maybe somewhere there's one who's more of a
pain in the butt than him... but I doubt it.

377
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,153
Well, good luck, man.
Now look, don't be too hard on Rimmer.

378
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,550
You got the break, he didn't, he's just bitter.

379
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:00,109
Do you know what that break was? At the age of seven,
one of us was kept back a year, the other one wasn't.

380
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,715
Put your finger on that, will you, Skipper?

381
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,589
That's the only difference?
Rimmer went down a year and you stayed up?

382
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,469
No, I was the one who went down a year.

383
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:16,672
By his terms, he got the break,
but being kept down a year made me.

384
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,629
The humiliation, being tallest
boy in the class by a clear foot.

385
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:25,633
it changed me, made me
buckle down, made me fight back.

386
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,114
- And I've been fighting back ever since.
- While he spent the rest of his life making excuses.

387
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,798
Maybe he's right. Maybe I did get the lucky break.

388
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,909
I'll grab my things and be off, Dave. Smoke me a kipper, Skipper,
I'll be back for breakfast.

389
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,398
Ready?

390
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,870
I'll smoke him a smegging kipper.

391
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,593
Now!
