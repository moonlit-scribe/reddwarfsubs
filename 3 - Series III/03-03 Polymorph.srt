(GRAVELLY VOICE) This week's "Red Dwarf"

00:00:03,741 --> 00:00:06,893
contains scenes which are unsuitable
for younger viewers

00:00:07,061 --> 00:00:09,450
and people of a nervous disposition.

(BLEEP) Danger.
Do not attempt to open this pod.

8
00:01:02,581 --> 00:01:05,733
The creature inside is extremely hostile.

9
00:01:05,901 --> 00:01:10,054
It feeds off the human psyche,
seeks out the deranged,

10
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:13,930
the unbalanced
and the emotionally crippled.

Here we go!

18
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:10,011
I just thought I'd just give your quarters
a quick tickle around, sir.

19
00:02:10,181 --> 00:02:12,616
- Won't take a jiff.
- Not now, Kryten. I'm cooking.

20
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:24,534
- I didn't know you could do that!
- Oh, yes.

21
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:26,897
I can plug a number of add-ons into my groinal socket

22
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:31,055
allowing me to perform virtually
any household task imaginable.

23
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:33,492
- Like what?
- Oh, you name it,

24
00:02:33,661 --> 00:02:36,494
buzz-saw, power drill, hedge trimmer...
even an egg whisk.

25
00:02:37,461 --> 00:02:41,534
What, so you like, stick the egg whisk attachment on the end
and you can whip up a Spanish omelette?

26
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:45,780
I certainly can, sir. But it's amazing how
few people are prepared to eat them.

27
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:50,777
Brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr, brr...

28
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:55,053
Goodness me!
I must have sucked up a penny.

29
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:01,140
I better change the old bag, there.
Yes, I'll just get a fresh one.

30
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,975
Mmm! Something smells good! What is it?

31
00:03:06,141 --> 00:03:09,338
It's me! I love this aftershave!

32
00:03:10,181 --> 00:03:13,617
You are five minutes away
from the greatest meal of your life, man.

33
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:16,091
Set your taste buds on Defcon 3!

34
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:19,096
Hey, you've really made an effort
here, where'd you get all this stuff?

35
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:22,896
I just got sick and tired of using plastic knifes and forks, man
so I went to the medical unit and nicked some gear.

36
00:03:23,101 --> 00:03:24,853
This is a scalpel!

37
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:29,371
I'm supposed to cut my food with a scalpel?
Something that's been inside someone's guts?

38
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:32,095
It's all been cleaned. It's washed. It's clean!

39
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:37,497
Something that long ago in history may well have
performed a certain popular Jewish operation?

00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,697
I'm supposed to eat with this?

41
00:03:40,861 --> 00:03:44,092
Get the onion salads out of the fridge.

44
00:03:51,901 --> 00:03:54,893
- Onion salads, onion salads...
- They're in the kidney bowls,

45

52

- What the hell is that?
- It's a syringe.

53
00:04:38,141 --> 00:04:40,781
- What kind of syringe?
- It's for cows.

54
00:04:40,941 --> 00:04:43,854
Artificial insemination. It's been washed.

55

- Excuse me.
- What about the meal?

This isn't a meal, it's an autopsy!

00:04:54,141 --> 00:04:56,518
This is just the starter, man,
what about the main course?

59
00:04:56,542 --> 00:04:58,374
Hey! You think I
got nothing better to do

60
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:02,057
than hang around watching you serve
chicken chasseur in a stool bucket?

61
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,650

00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:11,894
try and do something with a bit of class,

64
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,450
and where does it get you?

65
00:05:15,661 --> 00:05:17,857

00:05:40,941 --> 00:05:43,171
I just need to get a... (LAUGHS) Sorry.

69
00:05:43,381 --> 00:05:47,579
Oh, no, Kryten. It's all right.
Just running a few of the old home movies.

70
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:53,135
That's me, there. Those are my brothers -
John, Frank and Howard.

71
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,292
God, we were close.

72
00:05:55,461 --> 00:05:57,850
The Four Musketeers, we used to call ourselves.

73
00:05:58,021 --> 00:06:02,379
Well, the Three Musketeers, actually.
They always let me be the Queen of Spain.

74
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:06,774
Marvellous. I mean, yes, I was the butt
of the occasional practical joke,

75
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:09,370
but I mean, er...nothing sinister.

76
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:16,850
Just the usual boyhood pranks, you know -

77
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:20,616
apple-pie beds and black-eye telescopes...

78
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:25,093
One time, they even hid
a small landmine in my sandpit.

79
00:06:25,261 --> 00:06:27,821
They took it from my father's gun cabinet.

80
00:06:27,981 --> 00:06:30,541
I mean, how were they supposed
to know it was going to go off?

81
00:06:30,701 --> 00:06:33,819
- Marvellous guys.
- Oh, and er, who's that there?

82
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:36,052
- An old girlfriend, Mr. Arnold, sir?
- Hardly.

83
00:06:36,261 --> 00:06:39,777
No, not really your type, I
suppose. Silly old trout like that.

84
00:06:40,661 --> 00:06:46,054
- She's my mother.
- Oh! Oh, God! I am so sorry, sir...

85
00:06:46,221 --> 00:06:49,452
- Just forget it.
- Oh, how can I forget it, sir?

86
00:06:49,621 --> 00:06:53,535
I compared your mother
to a foolish, aged, blubbery fish.

87
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:58,013
I said she was
a simple-minded, scaly old piscine.

88
00:06:58,181 --> 00:07:01,811
I intimated she was an ugly,
lungless marine animal

89
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:03,972
with galloping senility,

90
00:07:04,141 --> 00:07:09,341
a putrid amphibious gill-breather
with less brains than a mollusc.

91
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,012
Forget it!

92
00:07:12,741 --> 00:07:15,733
Ah. Freeze.
There she is. Magnificent woman.

93
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:19,218
Very prim, very proper. Some say austere.

94
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:21,770
Some people took her for
cold, thought she was aloof.

95
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:26,697
Not a bit of it, just despised idiots,
no time for fools.

96
00:07:26,861 --> 00:07:29,660
Tragic, really,
otherwise we would have got on famously.

97
00:07:30,661 --> 00:07:35,212
well, if you'll excuse me, sir. I'll go now,
This is clearly a very private family moment.

98
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:38,214
I've no fish to embarrass you further.

99
00:07:38,381 --> 00:07:40,577
I'll let myself trout.

100
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:43,620
- Oh, sir, I'm...
- Just go!

101
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:50,339
I don't want you to panic, Arn, but it does appear
there's a very tiny possibility

102
00:07:50,501 --> 00:07:54,415
that there may very well in all likelyhood, possibly be
a non-human life form on board.

103
00:07:54,621 --> 00:07:57,739
You mean like last time?
When you got us all worked up

104
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:01,212
we went scooting off to the cargo bay
complete with bazookoids and backpacks,

105
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,372
and it turned out to be one of Lister's socks?

106
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,212
Well, I didn't recognise the genetic structure.

107
00:08:06,381 --> 00:08:08,975
Biologically speaking,
they were a completely new life form.

108
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:12,893
Absolutely ridiculous. I felt the total goit.

109
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:15,331
- I think you should take a butchers'.
- Where is it?

110
00:08:15,541 --> 00:08:19,011
I lost it. It's somewhere
along the habitation decks.

111
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:21,781
I can't get a moment's peace in this place! Just perfect!

112
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:27,419
- Enjoying your meal, sir?
- It's delicious, Kryten. De-smegging-licious!

113
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:29,652
It's my own recipe, you know?

114
00:08:29,821 --> 00:08:33,860
Shami Kebab Diablo. It's beautiful, man.
It's like eating molten lava.

115
00:08:34,501 --> 00:08:39,098

Oh, it's a good one, huh?

121
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:03,657

- Smeg, it's gone.

- What?
- How could that be! Where could it go?

124
00:09:09,341 --> 00:09:12,538
We better get out of here, Kryten.
Something very weird is going on.

125
00:09:12,701 --> 00:09:16,057
Something very, very... Ooh!
Sudden pain in my groin.

126
00:09:18,341 --> 00:09:20,730
- What's wrong?
- Ah! My underpants!

127
00:09:20,941 --> 00:09:24,696
They're shrinking. Oh, God!
Me boxers are alive, man!

128
00:09:24,901 --> 00:09:28,531
They're getting smaller! Help me, please!

129
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,732
Please, I'm begging you!

130
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:36,132
Get 'em off!

00:09:36,901 --> 00:09:39,541
- Pull them down!
- Keep still!

132
00:09:46,901 --> 00:09:50,292
Well, I can't say I'm totally shocked.

133
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,850
You'll bonk anything, won't you, Lister?

134
00:09:53,061 --> 00:09:56,053
- Kryten, the boxers, where are they?
- I threw them over here.

135
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,212
- You sure?
- There's nothing here.

- Snake!
- Kryten!

00:10:06,621 --> 00:10:10,376
- What the smeg is going on?!
- I hate snakes.

140
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,010
They freak me out totally, snakes.

141
00:10:13,181 --> 00:10:16,537
They are my all-time second-worst fear, guy.

144

This.

145
00:10:31,301 --> 00:10:32,974
Is he OK?

146
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:36,533
- As far as we can tell, yes.
- So, where did the creature go?

147
00:10:36,741 --> 00:10:41,053
It turned into a sort of, splodgy, squelchy thing
and squidged off down the corridor.

148
00:10:41,261 --> 00:10:45,653
- What is it? Some kind of alien?
- No, it's from Earth, man-made.

149
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:49,735
I checked out its DNA profile.
Some kind of genetic experiment that went wrong.

150
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:53,935
Apparently, it was an attempt
to create the ultimate warrior,

151
00:10:54,101 --> 00:10:57,571
a mutant that could change shape to
suit its terrain to deceive its enemies.

152
00:10:57,781 --> 00:11:00,739
- So what did go wrong?
- It's insane!

153
00:11:00,941 --> 00:11:03,330
It feeds off your negative emotions -

154
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:07,415
fear, guilt, anger, paranoia,
drains them out of its prey.

155
00:11:07,621 --> 00:11:10,010
Hmm. It's a sort of emotional vampire.

156
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:12,570
It changes shape
to provoke a negative emotion.

157
00:11:12,741 --> 00:11:18,100
In Lister's case, It took him to the very limit
of his terror, and then sucked out his fear.

158
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:21,293
- So now Lister's got no sense of fear?
- Precisely.

159
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:25,216
- What are we going to do?
- I say let's get out there and twat it.

160
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,775
Lister, you're ill. Just relax and leave this to us.

161
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:35,172
I could have had it in the sleeping quarters but you saw it, you saw it! It took me by surprise.

162
00:11:36,261 --> 00:11:39,777
Lister, it turned into an 8ft-tall
armour-plated alien killing machine.

163
00:11:39,981 --> 00:11:42,291
If it wants a barney, we'll give it one.

164
00:11:42,461 --> 00:11:45,977
One swift knee in the happy sacks,
it'll drop like anyone else.

165
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:49,091
Fine. We'll bear that in mind
when we're planning our strategy.

166
00:11:49,301 --> 00:11:52,612
I'm gonna rip out its windpipe and beat it to death with the tonsil end.

167
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:54,579
Yes, yes. Very good.

168
00:11:54,741 --> 00:12:00,039
I'm gonna stick my fist so far down its gob, I'm
gonna be able to pull the label off its underpants.

169
00:12:00,063 --> 00:12:01,255
Yes, yes. Er, Kryten...

170
00:12:03,741 --> 00:12:05,732
What's that, pal? You starting trouble?

171
00:12:05,941 --> 00:12:08,820
It's just a little something to calm you down, sir.

172
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:11,740
Come on, then. All of you slags!

173
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:16,293
All together or one at a time. I don't
care, it's all the same to me. I'm...

174
00:12:18,141 --> 00:12:22,294
Ah. Thank God for that.
Right, as far as I can see it, we have two options -

175
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:26,500
one - take it on and kill it,
or two - run away.

176
00:12:26,661 --> 00:12:30,097
- Who's for two?
- Two sounds pretty good to me, sir.

177
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:32,292
It's always been my lucky number.

178
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,214
- Right, well let's load up Starbug and get out of here.
- What about Lister?

179
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:39,210
Oh, just seal the hatch from the inside.
He'll be safe here, until we're ready to go.

180
00:12:39,421 --> 00:12:43,016
- Remember, it's out there and it could be anything.
- Let's move it.

181
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:48,057
What about the Space Corps directive
which states: "It is our primary overriding duty

182
00:12:48,221 --> 00:12:52,658
to contact other life forms, exchange information
and wherever possible, bring them home"?

183
00:12:53,181 --> 00:12:56,197
What about the Rimmer
directive, which states:

184
00:12:56,221 --> 00:13:00,470
"Never tangle with anything that's got more teeth
than the entire Osmond family"?

185
00:13:08,901 --> 00:13:10,892
(RAPID BEEPING)

186
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,299
It's here.

187
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,615
- Where?
- Somewhere.

188
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:20,770
Set the bazookoids to heat-seeker.

189
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,941
When you see it, aim roughly in its direction,

190
00:13:25,101 --> 00:13:28,298
and the heat-seekers will do the rest.

191
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:45,700
Shadows... In the shadows...
It's in the shadows! There! There! There!

192
00:13:49,141 --> 00:13:51,701
Sorry. My fault. False alarm.

193
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:55,259
Idiot.

194
00:14:01,781 --> 00:14:05,934
I don't understand it, holograms
don't produce heat and neither do androids.

195
00:14:06,101 --> 00:14:08,411
What are they homing in on?

196
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:12,538
So long, guys.

197
00:14:47,741 --> 00:14:49,891
Oh, come on! Give me a break!

198
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:04,578
You either got it or you ain't,
and, boys, you ain't even close.

199
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:07,652
(LISTER) Cat, where are you?

200
00:15:07,821 --> 00:15:11,576
- Over here.
- Stay put, we'll come and find you.

201
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:13,857
Keep talking.

202
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:26,935
What are you looking for?

203
00:15:27,101 --> 00:15:29,820
A mutant. It's dangerous.
It can turn into anything.

204
00:15:30,021 --> 00:15:32,058
Oh, sounds pretty scary.

205
00:15:32,221 --> 00:15:34,212
It is, baby. Believe me.

206
00:15:35,501 --> 00:15:40,177
It must take a really brave sort
of guy to do this kind of work.

207
00:15:40,341 --> 00:15:44,096
- Well, I guess you're right.
- And smart, I bet you have to be smart.

208
00:15:44,261 --> 00:15:46,935
Smart? Yeah,
you definitely have to be smart.

209
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:51,140
Like I say, it can turn into anything.
You gotta have your wits about you all the time.

210
00:15:51,301 --> 00:15:56,137
Don't let up for one second, or it'll just creep up on you and - blip!
- you're dog meat.

211
00:15:56,301 --> 00:16:01,216
- Come on, man.
- You know, you're really quite a guy,

212
00:16:01,381 --> 00:16:05,852
- Brave, smart, handsome...
- Oh, you think handsome?

213
00:16:06,061 --> 00:16:10,578
Oh, come on. You know, you're probably
the best-looking guy I've ever seen.

214
00:16:10,781 --> 00:16:15,776
- I wasn't going to be the first to say.
- Do you know what I'd really like?

215
00:16:15,941 --> 00:16:18,376
- Hmm?
- I'd really like to make love to a guy like you.

216
00:16:20,741 --> 00:16:24,496
Well, I'm sure I have a window
in my schedule somewhere.

217
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:29,053
Let's see... What are you doing in,
say, ten seconds time?

218
00:16:29,221 --> 00:16:34,091
- Nothing I couldn't cancel.
- Hi. I'm the Cat.

219
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:37,339
Hi. I'm the genetic mutant.

220
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,977
Glad to know you. Jenny who?

221
00:16:41,141 --> 00:16:43,132
(ROARS)

222
00:16:47,461 --> 00:16:48,860
It's got him, it's got him!

223
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:53,017
Oh! Oh, my goodness! Are you all right?

224
00:16:53,861 --> 00:16:55,977
- Is he dead?
- Unconscious,

225
00:16:56,141 --> 00:16:58,894
but, according to the psi-scan,
he appears to have lost an emotion.

226
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,251
- Which emotion?
- He's lost his vanity.

227
00:17:01,461 --> 00:17:04,419
- This is your fault, Kryten.
- M-M-My fault?

228
00:17:04,621 --> 00:17:06,737
We were supposed to stick
together. You let the Cat run off alone.

229
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:10,457
- But it wasn't, I mean...
- He trusted you. Now look at him.

230
00:17:10,661 --> 00:17:13,494
- Oh, please. I feel so...
- (GROWLS) Guilty?

231
00:17:13,661 --> 00:17:17,177
- Yes.
- Good! (SCREECHES)

232
00:17:26,901 --> 00:17:28,460
Hah!

233
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:31,579
(ROARS)

234
00:17:31,981 --> 00:17:33,380
Shoo! Shoo!

235
00:17:33,861 --> 00:17:35,181
(ZIP!)

236
00:17:36,301 --> 00:17:37,700
(MUTTERS)

237
00:17:40,141 --> 00:17:44,977
- Let's just get Lister and get out of here.
- It's got my guilt, I have lost the single emotion

238
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:49,533
which prevents my transgressing
the mores and manners of civilised society.

239
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:52,381
Stop your blithering, Kryten.
Come on, grab the Cat and let's go!

240
00:17:52,581 --> 00:17:54,697
Oh, screw you, hadron-head!

241
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,179
(CREAKS)

242
00:17:58,621 --> 00:18:00,578
(MUTTERING)

243
00:18:03,341 --> 00:18:05,537
Where have you been? Let's go!

244
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:08,693
(SLURS) I was getting myself comfortable, man.

245
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:14,091
- Come on, Kryten. You're holding us all up.
- Ah, who cares?

246
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:16,775
- You're going to get us all killed.
- So?

247
00:18:27,021 --> 00:18:30,332
Oh, look. It's Bonehead's mum.

248
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,578
- Mother?
- Hello, dear.

249
00:18:33,781 --> 00:18:37,536
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like, darling?

250
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,972
- You made love to my mother?
- Yeah. Do you wanna make something of it?

251
00:18:41,261 --> 00:18:45,095
- It's not your mother, it's the polymorph!
- You've just had my mum?!

252
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:49,056
Five times. He was like a wild stallion.

253
00:18:50,181 --> 00:18:53,970
"Very prim, very proper. Almost austere."

254
00:18:54,821 --> 00:18:57,051
Don't fall for it, Arn, it's trying to make you angry.

255
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,094
Darling, I wish
you could have seen him in action.

256
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:04,380
He was like a set of pistons
in an ocean liner engine room.

257
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,532
I think I'm going to be sick.

258
00:19:06,741 --> 00:19:10,132
- Don't get angry, that's what it wants.
- Lister and mother...

259
00:19:10,301 --> 00:19:12,451
it's a dream come true.

260
00:19:12,621 --> 00:19:14,692
He's so energetic.

261
00:19:14,861 --> 00:19:18,820
I honestly thought
my false teeth were going to fall out.

262
00:19:18,981 --> 00:19:22,337
- How lovely.
- The positions he bent me into!

263
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:25,732
Terrific. That sounds enchanting. Well done.

264
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:30,498
And the things this boy can do
with Alphabetti Spaghetti.

265
00:19:30,661 --> 00:19:35,053
- Cool it, Arnie.
- ALPHABETTI SPAGHETTI?!

266
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:54,852
- So, where is it now?
- It's gone back down to the cargo bays,

267
00:19:55,021 --> 00:19:57,630
sleeping off a four-course meal
of fear, vanity, guilt and anger.

268
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,731
You better get it before it
comes back for seconds.

269
00:20:02,221 --> 00:20:05,737
Look, just because it's an armour-plated
alien killing machine

270
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:08,415
that salivates unspeakable slobber,

271
00:20:08,581 --> 00:20:11,016
doesn't mean it's a bad person.

272
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:13,615
What we've got to
is get it round a table,

273
00:20:13,639 --> 00:20:15,937
put together a solution package.
Perhaps over tea and biscuits.

274
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:18,530
Look at him. You can't trust his opinion.

275
00:20:18,701 --> 00:20:20,692
He's got no anger. He's a total dork.

276
00:20:20,901 --> 00:20:25,020
Good point, Kryten.
Let's take that on board, shall we?

277
00:20:25,181 --> 00:20:27,855
David... David. Do you have anything
you want to bring to this forum?

278
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:31,491
Well, yes. I have, actually, Arnold.

279
00:20:31,661 --> 00:20:33,937
Why don't we go down
to the ammunition stores,

280
00:20:34,101 --> 00:20:37,696
get the nuclear warheads
and then strap one to my head.

281
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:40,057
I'll nut the smegger to oblivion.

282
00:20:40,861 --> 00:20:45,298
Right, well, that's very nice, David.
Let's put that on the back burner, shall we?

283
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:47,896
Cat, let's have your contribution. Come on.

284
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:51,417
Hey, don't ask me my opinion. I'm nobody.
Just pretend I'm not here.

285
00:20:51,621 --> 00:20:56,172
That's lovely. Thank you very much.
Moving on a step...

286
00:20:56,381 --> 00:21:00,056
and I hope no-one thinks that I'm
setting myself up as self-elected chairperson.

287
00:21:00,221 --> 00:21:04,180
Just see me as a facilitator.
Kryten, what's your view? Don't be shy.

288
00:21:04,341 --> 00:21:06,901
Well, I think we should send Lister in as a decoy,

289
00:21:07,061 --> 00:21:09,052
and while it's busy eating him alive,

290
00:21:09,221 --> 00:21:12,259
we could creep up on it unawares
and blast it into the stratosphere.

291
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:16,178
Good plan. That's the best plan yet.

292
00:21:16,341 --> 00:21:18,571
Let it get knackered eating me to death,

293
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:20,812
then you guys can just, like, catch it unawares.

294
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:23,771
Well, that's certainly an option, David, yes.

295
00:21:23,941 --> 00:21:28,139
Um, but here's my proposal. Let's get tough.

296
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:30,531
The time for talking is over.

297
00:21:30,701 --> 00:21:34,979
Call it extreme if you like, but I propose
we hit it hard and hit it fast

298
00:21:35,141 --> 00:21:40,056
with a major,
and I mean major, leaflet campaign.

299
00:21:40,221 --> 00:21:44,340
And while it's reeling from that,
we follow up with a whist drive,

300
00:21:44,501 --> 00:21:47,061
a car-boot sale, some street theatre

301
00:21:47,221 --> 00:21:49,690
and possibly even some benefit concerts. OK?

302
00:21:49,861 --> 00:21:53,980
Now, if that's not enough,
I'm sorry, it's time for the T-shirts.

303
00:21:54,141 --> 00:21:59,500
"Mutants Out."
"Chameleonic Life Forms? No, Thanks."

304
00:21:59,661 --> 00:22:01,937
And if that's not enough, then I don't know what will be!

305
00:22:02,141 --> 00:22:06,533
Has anyone ever told you that
you are a disgusting pus-filled bubo

306
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:09,170
who has all the wit, charm and self-possession

307
00:22:09,341 --> 00:22:12,015
of an Alsatian dog
after a head-swap operation?

308
00:22:13,661 --> 00:22:17,541
Listen, you bunch of tarts, it's clobbering time!

309
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:21,057
There's a body bag out there
with that scud-ball's name on it.

310
00:22:21,221 --> 00:22:25,738
And I'm doing up the zip. Anyone
who gets in my way gets a napalm enema.

311
00:22:26,821 --> 00:22:31,816
(SLURS) I think everybody's right,
except me, so just forget I spoke, huh?

312
00:22:32,021 --> 00:22:36,731
Um, I think we're all beginning
to lose sight of the real issue here,

313
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:39,814
which is what are we going to call ourselves?

314
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:45,101
I think it comes down to a choice between
the League Against Salivating Monsters

315
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:47,491
or my own personal preference,

316
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:51,211
which is the Committee for the Liberation
and Integration of Terrifying Organisms

317
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:54,373
and their Rehabilitation Into Society.

318
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:57,932
Erm, one drawback with that,
the abbreviation is CLITORIS.

319
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:03,772
Look, it needs killing!

320
00:23:03,941 --> 00:23:09,061
If that means I have to sacrifice my life
in some stupid, pointless way, then all the better.

321
00:23:09,261 --> 00:23:12,060
Yes. Why not? I mean, even if it
doesn't work, it'll still be a laugh.

322
00:23:13,021 --> 00:23:16,935
Right, so let's just cut all
of this business and get on with it.

323
00:23:17,101 --> 00:23:20,219
Last one alive's a wet ponce. Who's with me?

324
00:23:20,421 --> 00:23:23,061
Well, the car stickers aren't ready till Thursday,

325
00:23:23,221 --> 00:23:26,373
but sometimes
one just has to act spontaneously.

326
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:28,851
- People, let's go.
- I'm coming, too.

327
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:31,092
Maybe I can bum some money from him.

328
00:23:31,261 --> 00:23:36,051
 Maybe if I hand you guys over,
it'll let me go. Move it, suckers!

330
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,852
(RIMMER) # Love everybody

331
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,012
# All you need is love... #

332
00:24:13,181 --> 00:24:15,172
Come on, you chicken!

333
00:24:15,341 --> 00:24:18,732
Show us your slobbery chops
and we'll blow them off.

334
00:24:20,861 --> 00:24:24,058
Here they are, nice juicy humans.
Come and get them.

335
00:24:24,221 --> 00:24:26,690
Here, mutie-mutant!

(ROARS)

338
00:24:48,701 --> 00:24:51,341
Phewee! What am I wearing?

339
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:54,260
Oh, how can you ever forgive me, sirs?

340
00:24:54,421 --> 00:24:56,697
Naturally, I will commit suicide immediately.

341
00:24:56,861 --> 00:25:00,058
Hey, we were all a bit whacked out there.

342
00:25:00,221 --> 00:25:02,974
- You can say that again.
- Come on, let's go and clean up.

343
00:25:03,141 --> 00:25:05,337
If I don't get into some coordinated evening wear,

344
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:10,621
I'm going to have to resign my post
as Most Handsome Guy on the Ship.

00:25:36,941 --> 00:25:39,774
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

347
00:25:39,941 --> 00:25:43,252
# I'm all alone, more or less

348
00:25:43,421 --> 00:25:46,618
# Let me fly far away from here

349
00:25:46,781 --> 00:25:49,455
# Fun, fun, fun

00:25:53,341 --> 00:25:56,697
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

# Drinking fresh mango juice

353
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:03,452
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

# Fun, fun, fun
