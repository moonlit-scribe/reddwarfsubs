The only reason they don't give

Lister, if you must know. What I did was,
I wrote a discourse on porous circuits

55
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,677
which was simply
too "radical", too "unconventional",

56
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,637
too "mould-breaking" for the

00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,110
Indeed. Now, Rimmer, I'm just going
through McIntyre's artifacts,

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,990
and I see that you've filed
247 complaints... against Lister.

00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:38,553
- Yes, sir!
- That's 123 counts of "insulting a superior technician"

65
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,519
39 counts of  "dereliction of duty",

84 counts of "general insubordination",

- and one count of "mutiny".
- Yes, sir!

68

- "Mutiny", Lister?
- I stood on his toe.

69

- Maliciously, and with intent to wound.
- It was an accident!

70
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,077
Lister, I put it to you. How is it possible to stand
on one small toe by accident?

71
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,993
You didn't stand on my toe at all,
you stood on my entire foot,

72
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,720
thereby obstructing a superior technician
in pursuit of vital duty.

73
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:04,315
But the "vital duty" was him going
to snap my guitar in half!

74
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,552
Whereupon you leapt from the top bunk
onto the whole of my right foot.

75
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,950
- Alright, that's enough.
- Had there been a crisis situation, Lister,

my duties hopping

for the death penalty.

You, see I try, sir.
I'm not an insubordinate man by nature.

I try to respect Rimmer and everything,
but it's not easy.

84
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,958
Because he's such a smeghead.

85
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,312
Did you hear that, sir?
Lister, do you have any conception

86
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,677
of the penalty for describing
a superior technician as a 'smeghead'?

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,993
Oh, Rimmer. You ARE a smeghead.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,496

could ever hope to have.

more completely than he could ever know.

to the stars he loved so much.

Off!

- Hey, I was watching that!
- Well, tough!

104
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,791
You touch that guitar, Lister, I'll remove
the E-string and garrotte you with it.

105
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,714

if I breathe? Can I breathe?

106
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,554
Lister, I have an exam tomorrow
which I intend to pass!

107
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,711
I know, yeah, by cheating.

108
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,918
This is not cheating!
It is merely an aid to memory.

109
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,116
It helps me marshal the facts
already at my command.

What does? Copying the entire
textbooks onto your body?

111
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:11,632
Why don't you hand your body in
and let them mark that?

112
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,797
Lister, so you think it is easy for someone
like me to become an officer?

113
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,996
Someone who wasn't Academy educated?

114
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,192
Someone who didn't have
the right nobby background?

115
00:07:20,216 --> 00:07:22,074
Someone who didn't
have the right parents?

116
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,358
You didn't have right parents?
Whose parents did you have?

117
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,676
MY parents. The wrong parents.

118
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:32,151
I'm just saying, y'know, if you can't
pass fair and square, why bother?

119
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,159
Well you would, Lister,
because you've no ambition, no drive.

120
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,595
You're perfectly content to
be the lowest rank on this ship.

121
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,640
I'm not the lowest rank on this ship.
What about the laboratory mice?

122
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,678
Tell those mice to do something
and they've got to jump to it.

123
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,752
"Yes, Mr Lister, sir! Eee, eee, eee."

124

125

I'm not a nothing. I've got me plan.

entity in the entire universe?

No. Me Five Year Plan.

128
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:02,151
You see, I'm going to do two more trips.
I've been saving up all me pay...

129
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,470
- Since when?
- Since always.

130
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,951
That's why I never buy any soap or deodorant or
socks or anything like that. Y'know?

131
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,873
Anyway, I'm going to buy meself a little farm on Fiji

132
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,873
and I'm going to get a sheep
and a cow and breed horses.

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,397
- With a sheep and a cow?
- No, with horses and horses.

134
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,472
- On Fiji?
- Yeah! The prices there are unbelievable.

135
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,677
Yes, because they had a volcanic eruption,

136
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,990
and now most of Fiji's
three feet below sea level!

137
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,151
It's only three feet. They can wade.

138
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,472
That's why the animals are
going to have to be quite tall.

139
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,952
Nice plan, Lister! Excellent plan!
Brilliant plan, Lister!

140
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,556
What about the sheep? What are you
going to do? Buy them water wings?

141
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,958
Fit them with stilts?

142
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,238
Better still, you could cross-breed them
with dolphins and have leaping mutton!

Baa, pssh, baa, pssh.

You can get a drainage grant these days.

145
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,912
Why bother, Lister? You could be the
first man to produce wet-look knitwear!

146
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,008
Look, this is why I
never, ever said anything to you

147
00:09:02,032 --> 00:09:04,039
because I knew you'd
say something like this.

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,840

great new intelligence test.

What you gotta do is force
the coin onto your forehead.

can bang yourself on the head

160

00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,476
- Are you ready? Can you feel it?
- Yeah!

163
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,376
- Can you feel it?
- Yep!

164
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,416
- Can you feel it?
- Yep

165
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,973
- Go!
(ALL) Go on, Petersen! Go for it!

- Shhhh! shhhh!

168
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,431
Folks, today is a day
for both sadness and joy.

169
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:31,275
Sadness for the passing
away of George, and joy,

170
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,751
because George is back
with us... albeit as a hologram.

171
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:37,127
Now some of you may not have
travelled with a hologram before

172
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:39,437
so I ask you to
treat him as a normal man,

173
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,592
because he is in every respect like George.

174
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,435
He has George's personality, and
George's knowledge and experience.

175
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,194
Of course, he can't lift
anything or touch anything,

176
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,079
so I ask you to cooperate with his requests.

177
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,278
And please take every care
not to walk through him,

178
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,351
not even when you're in a hurry. Thank you.

179

(ALL) Whoa! Whoa
(LISTER) Speech! Speech!

180
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,354
I want to thank everybody
for giving me such a marvellous funeral.

181
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:12,431
I've just seen the vid.

182
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,558
And I want to thank the Captain
for his beautiful eulogy.

183
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,512
Beautiful.

184
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,149
But I still don't understand why
didn't he use the one I wrote!

185
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,234
This must seem pretty spooky for everyone,

186
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:31,712
but I don't want you to think
of me as someone who's dead,

187
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,430
more as someone who's no longer
a threat to your marriages.

188
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,273
I think Joe knows
what I'm talking about!

189
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:47,795
As you know, Holly's only
capable of sustaining one hologram.

190
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,953
So, my advice to anyone
more vital to the mission than me is:

191
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,872
if you die, I'll kill you.

192
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,158

Right, they're bound
to ask the right thigh,

00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:42,358
which is 10%.

204
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,035
They must ask the left thigh, which is 20%.

205
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,760
They've got to ask one of the forearms.

206
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,231
Which means I've passed already!
Anything on the left shin's a bonus!

Right. CUTIE: current under tension is...

What's this? Current under tension is equal?

209

Current under tension is expandable?

210
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,189
Current under tension is expensive?

What does this mean?

spell "Fish", and you just keel over.

we can give it water and pretend it's milk.

it says "Captain's Office".

You asked to see me, Captain?

- Where's the cat?
- What? What cat?

254
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,157
Lister, not only are you so stupid

255
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,390
you bring aboard an unquarantined animal

256
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,994
and jeopardise every man
and woman on this ship...

257
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:25,119
not only that, but you take a
photograph of yourself with the cat

258
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,669
and sent it to be
processed in the ship's lab.

259

Now, I'm gonna ask you
again, do you have a cat?

- No.
- Have you got a cat?

Yes, that one.

- Where did you get it, Titan?
- Yes.

Don't you realise that thing
could be carrying anything?!

264
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,792
Don't you remember what happened
on the Oregon with the rabbits?

265
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,918
Lister, a loose animal aboard
this ship could get anywhere.

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,879
It could get into the air ducts.
It could get into Holly.

00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,918
You know, a little nibble here
and a little nibble there, Lister,

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
and before you know it,
we're flying backwards.

269
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,234
Now, I want that cat, and I want it NOW.

270
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:03,314
Sir, just suppose I did have a cat. Just suppose.

271
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,710
What would you do with Frankenstein?

272
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,669
I'd send it down to the medical centre,
and I'd have it cut up and tests run on it.

273
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,070
Would you put it back
together, when you'd finished?

274
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:15,240
Lister, the cat would be dead.

275
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,113
So, with respect, sir,
what's in it for the cat?

276
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,032
Lister, give me that cat!

277
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,909
It's not that easy as that! Me and
the cat, we're gonna have a baby cat,

278
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,879
and we're going to buy a farm on Fiji,

279
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,520
and we're gonna have a sheep
and a cow and three horses.

280
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,037
It's me plan, and no one can get in the way of it,
not even you, and I do respect you.

281
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,231
- Sir!
- Oh, Lister,

282
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,234
do you want to go into stasis for the rest
of the trip and forfeit 18 months' wages?

283
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,118
- No
- Do you wanna hand over that cat?

284
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,158
Gordon Bennet! Yes, Chen, everybody

285
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,999
Look, Dave, no one wants
to go through with this.

286
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:50,678
It's OK, I can handle it.

287
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,358
- Rimmer, are you all right?
- I can't really remember.

288
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,431
I think I did quite well.

289
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,799
- Is this going to hurt?
- Haven't you ever travelled interstellar?

290
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,553
- No
- Ah, you don't feel a thing.

291
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,439
The stasis room creates
a static field of time.

292
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,912
See, just as X-rays can't pass through lead,
time cannot penetrate the stasis field.

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,514
So, although you exist,
you no longer exist in time

294
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,511
and for you time itself does not exist.

295
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,956
You see, although you're still a mass, you
are no longer an event in space-time,

296
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:22,680
you are a non-event mass
with a quantum probability of zero.

297
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,433
Oh, simple as that, eh?

298
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,553
- OK, I'm ready.
- See you in 18 months.

299
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,437
- Holly, activate the stasis field.
- OK, Frank.

300
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,035
Good morning, Dave. It is now
safe for you to emerge from stasis.

301
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,353

00:19:58,377 --> 00:20:00,909
Please proceed to the
Drive Room for debriefing.

00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,351
Where is everybody, Hol?

304
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,319
- They're dead, Dave.
- Who is?

305
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:15,280
- Everybody, Dave.
- What, Captain Hollister?

- What, Todhunter?

00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,353
- Everybody's dead, Dave.
- What, Selby?

308
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,273
They're all dead. Everybody's dead, Dave.

309
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,715
- Petersen isn't, is he?
- Everybody is dead, Dave.

310
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,269
- Not Chen?
- Gordon Bennet! Yes! Everybody.

311
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,159
- Everybody's dead, Dave.
- Rimmer?

312
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,234
He's dead, Dave. Everybody is dead.
Everybody. Is. Dead. Dave!

313
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,712
Wait. Are you trying to tell me everybody's dead?

314
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,711
I should've never let
him out in the first place.

315
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:51,776
How?

316
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,510
The drive plate was
inefficiently repaired.

317
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,753
It blew, and the entire crew was
subjected to a lethal dose of Cadmium-2

318
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,478
before I could seal the area.

319
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:04,918
Oh, this is terrible. And why's it so
dirty around here, Hol? What is this stuff?

320
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,594
That is Catering Officer Olaf Petersen.

321
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,435
Aaaah! I've been eating half the crew!

322
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,914
- Who's that?
- That's Captain Hollister.

323
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:18,152
- And that's Todhunter.
- No, that's Second Technician Rimmer.

324
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,109
Oh, yeah? I didn't recognise him
without his report book.

325
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,557
What was Rimmer
doing in the Drive Room?

326
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,395
He was explaining to the Captain why
he hadn't sealed the drive plate properly.

327
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:32,440
So wait, Hol. How long was I in stasis?

328
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:36,275
Well, I couldn't release you until the
radiation reached a safe background level

329
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,079
- How long?
- Three million years.

330
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,356
Three million years!

331
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,670
I've still got that library book.

332
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,919
What about Krissie?
What about Krissie Kochanski?

333
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,640
- She's dead, Dave.
- Aw, hey!

334
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,111
I don't suppose it's any
consolation, but if she were

335
00:21:54,135 --> 00:21:56,670
still alive, the age difference
would be insurmountable.

336
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,633
She was part of me plan.

337
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,236
I never got round to telling her, but
she was going to come with me to Fiji.

338
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:06,073
She was to wear a white dress
and ride the horses.

339
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,074
I was going to take care of everything
else. It was me plan. I planned it.

340
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,800
Well, she won't be much use to you on Fiji now.

341
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,793
Not unless it snows and you need
something to grit the path with.

342
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,471
- Holly?!
- Sorry. I'm sorry about that.

343
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:26,155
I've been on me own for three million years,
and I'm just used to saying what I think.

344
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,960
I think I've gone a bit
peculiar, to tell you the truth.

345
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,033
So everyone's dead?
I'm on me own? There's just me?

346
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:35,670
- Well, technically speaking, yeah.
- What do you mean, "technically speaking"?

347
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:41,239
Hello, Lister. Long time no see.

348
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,677
- Rimmer, you're a hologram!
- Yes. That's because I'm dead.

349
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,276
Dead as a can of Spam.
And it's all thanks to you.

350
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:52,069
- Me? What did I do?
- If you hadn't kept that stupid cat, Lister

351
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,208
and hadn't been sent to stasis,
I would have had some help

352
00:22:54,232 --> 00:22:56,279
when I was mending the drive
plate and I wouldn't be dead.

353
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:59,273
- What does it feel like?
- Death?

354
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,239
It's like being on holiday
with a group of Germans.

355
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,314
No, I mean being a hologram.

356
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,950
Do you mind? Being a hologram is fine, Lister.

357
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,237
I still have the same drives,
the same feelings, the same emotions,

358
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,789
but I can't touch anything.

359
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,872
Never again will I be able
to brush a rose against my cheek,

360
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,349
cradle a laughing child,

361
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,909
or interfere with a woman sexually.

362
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,119
Rimmer, you never used to
do any of those things anyway!

363
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,232
- I would have one day, murderer.
- Hey! Hey! I didn't do anything!

364
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,472
It was YOU who didn't fix
the drive plates properly.

365
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,756
- Is this me here?
- Yeah.

366
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,514
- Me?
- Come on, Rimmer, look on the bright side.

367
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,274
The bright side? What bright side?

368
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,079
I'm dead. I'm composed entirely of light,

369
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,367
and I'm alone in space with
a man who'd lose a battle

370
00:23:46,391 --> 00:23:48,597
of wits with a stuffed iguana.
Where's the bright side?

371
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,871
What's an iguana?

372
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,839
Look, look, you're not dead, are ya?

373
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:57,629
I mean, you're dead! But not "dead" dead,
'cause you're still here, aren't ya?

374
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,429
Lister, I'm not really here!
I'm not really me! Don't you see?

375
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,750
I'm a computer simulation of me.

376
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:07,435
That's me, there,
that pile of albino mouse droppings.

377
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,670
Come on. Lots of people have died.

378
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,832
Lots of people have died and gone on
and done really, really well.

379
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:15,196
You're a hologram. So what?

380
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,955
I suppose you're right, Lister.
I've got to pull myself together.

381
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,396
But you've got to help me. You've
got to be my hands and my touch.

382
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,598
I know the sort of things you like
to touch. No way, Rimmer. Forget it.

383
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,637
Are you smoking, Lister? In the Drive Room?

384
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,191
Yeah. I stopped for a while,
but I'm back on them now.

385
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,471
You're on report, squire.

386
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,393
I can't write it down. I'll remember it.

387
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:45,230
Ohhh! Rimmer, I know it's wrong of
me to speak ill of the dead and all that

388
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:48,153
- but you're still a smeghead.
- I beg your pardon?

389
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,231
I said, you're still a smeghead.

390
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,311
Lister, do you have any
conception of the penalty

391
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,392
for describing a deceased
superior technician as a smeghead?

392
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:12,549
- Will you listen to me? Just listen to me. Just shut up, just shut up!

393
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:22,752
Aaahhh! Aow! Eeee!

394
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,673
Aow, eee, how am I looking?

395
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:32,070
Looking nice. No, wait a minute.

396
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,312
I'm looking better than nice.
I'm looking dangerous.

397
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,156
Aaaoooww. Dangerous! Aaaooowww!
Hey, what's that?

398
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,554
Oh, it's my shadow.
Hey, even my shadow's looking nice.

399
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:49,474
I'm looking nice. My shadow's
looking nice. What a team!

400
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:53,110
We are unbelievable! OK, team, this way.

401
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,231
No, this way. Aaaooowww...

402
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,200
Aaaoowww, yeah. This way!

403
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,837
Lister, just hold your
horses, listen to me...

404
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,794
Aaaooowww!

405
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:12,679
Uh, oh! Better make myself look big!

406
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,836
Hee hee! Fearsome. I was fearsome!

407
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:23,515
 # Just me and my shadow, ooohhh! #

408
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,876
Come on, boy! # Walking down the... #

409
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:32,674
Aaahhh! Holly, what was that?

410
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,159
During the radioactive crisis, Dave,
your cat and her kittens

411
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,197
were safely sealed in the hold,

412
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,112
and they've been breeding
there for three million years,

413
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,695
and have evolved into the
life-form you just saw in the corridor.

414
00:26:43,719 --> 00:26:44,876
I don't get it.

415
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,291
Well, you know how
mankind evolved from apes?

416
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,318
Yeah, I know that.

417
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,518
He evolved from cats. His ancestors were cats.

418
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,479
He descended from cats. He is a cat.

419
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,549
Aaahhh, ooohhh, yeah...

420
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,879
Hello... Cat?

421
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,913
Whoa! Crease!

422
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:10,837
Stand back, Lister.
(SHOUTS INCOHERENTLY)

423
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,279
- Here you go, Cat.
- Ah, crispies!

424
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,636
- Holly says you like these.
- Mmmm!

425
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,190
Hey! You monkeys eat off the floor?

426
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:28,557
Ain't you got no style or sophistication?

427
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,916
I'm sorry, Cat. I'm sorry.

428
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,311
You people are unbelievable.

429
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,494
Where are all your other
your catty friends, Cat?

430
00:27:39,518 --> 00:27:40,879
Good crispies, man!

431
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,157
Where are your other little kitties? Are they
gone? Are they dead? Have they left, yet?

432
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,789
Who cares? I want it off the ship!

433
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,111
No! He's coming home with us, aren't you, Cat?

434
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,589
Home? And where exactly
is 'home' supposed to be?

435
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,488
Earth.

436
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:55,718
Earth?! What makes you
think there'll BE any Earth, Lister

437
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,360
And even if there is, look what it's done
to a household pet in three million years.

438
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,716
Can you imagine what
humankind has evolved into?

439
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,589
To them, you'll be the equivalent of the
slime that first crawled out the oceans.

440
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,639
- I could smarten meself up a bit.
- Nah, you're a dinosaur.

441
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:11,315
- You're extinct, you've got nothing.
- Hey! Hey! I've still got me plan.

442
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,280
And I've still got a cat. Okay, it's
not Frankenstein, but it's still a cat.

443
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,311
- Did you say Frankenstein?
- Yeah.

444
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,472
She was your great, great, great,
great, great, great grandmother or something.

445
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:24,519
The Holy Mother? The Virgin Birth?
No one believes that stuff.

446
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,114
The Virgin Birth?!

447
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,794
No, it was a big black tom on Titan.

448
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,316
Frankenstein, yeah! I remember
that stuff from kitty school.

449
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:37,280
The Holy Mother, saved
by Cloister the Stupid,

450
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,397
who was frozen in time,

451
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,676
and who gaveth of his
life that we might live.

452
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,118
No! No, it's not Cloister, it's me, it's Lister!

453
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,555
It's Lister the...stupid?!

454
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:54,112
who shall returneth to lead us
to Fuchal, the Promised Land.

455
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,919
No, it's not Fuchal, it's Fiji!

456
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,991
And I will! I'll lead you there.

457
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:03,551
That's where we're going.
Holly, plot a course for Fiji.

458
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:07,395
Look out, Earth. The slime's coming home!

459
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:15,669
# It's cold outside,
There's no kind of atmosphere

460
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,991
# I'm all alone, more or less

461
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,152
# Let me fly far away from here

462
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,392
# Fun, fun, fun

463
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:28,791
# In the sun, sun, sun

464
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,396
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

465
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,518
# Drinking fresh mango juice

466
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,991
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

467
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,071
# Fun, fun, fun

468
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,440
# In the sun, sun, sun

469
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,512
# Fun, fun, fun

470
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,195
# In the sun, sun, sun #
