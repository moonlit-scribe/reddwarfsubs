This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship "Red Dwarf".

3
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,478
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak.

4
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,517
The only survivors were: Dave Lister,

5
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,194
who was in suspended animation
during the disaster,

6
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,113
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold.

Revived three million years later,

8
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,075
Lister's only companions are:
a life form who evolved from his cat

I had that conversation with Lister.
Knock...4 minutes off for that.

33
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,553
but I stopped to have a rest, so I wouldn't
look too shagged out when I went past him.

- Just get on with it. Very short.
- OK, Arnold.

50
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,594
- Have you done it, Hol?
- Yes.

51
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,877
- A crewcut, and it's very short?
- Yes, Arnold.

really, really, really, really thrilled to meet me.

- Who's that guy?
- That's me grandmother.

OK, will you do that for me?

70
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:21,673

anyplace, because if he is I may have to chase him.

-Yeah

- Who?

00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,709

00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,356
- Rimmer, what have you done to your hair?
- Holly did it.

84
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,829
- Why?
- Because I ordered him to.

85
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,038
- It looks ridiculous.
- It may look ridiculous to you, Lister

86
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,873
but I like it like this. makes me feel like a man.

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,959
Yeah. And you'll probably
get one, looking like that.

88
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,237
Nothing wrong with short hair, Lister. It gives a man
a sense of dignity, a sense of discipline.

89
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,392
- Rimmer, have you seen it?
- I don't need to see it.

90
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,391
I didn't get this haircut to look good.

91
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,030
This is a haircut designed for action,
not poncing around in.

92
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,909
Maybe a bit severe. A bit too Green Beret.

93
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:04,031
But you are how you look, and I look...
like a complete and total tit!

95
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,951
This is a recording. I'm afraid
Holly is busy at the moment.

96
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:15,715
If you'd like to leave a message
after the bleep, he'll get back to you.

97

I'll see you toast on the fires of Hell for this.

101
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,309
Did someone say they wanted toast?

102
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,710
Shut up.

103
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:37,350
- What are you doing?
- I'm going into stasis, I thought Holly told you?

104
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,158
Stasis? What for?

105
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,356
Well, Holly said to go into it
while we went through light speed.

106
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,558
And then I thought, what the hell, why not stay
till we get back to Earth.

107
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,996
Earth?! But, that's
three million years away.

108
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,913
You can't leave me alone for
three million years, I'll go peculiar.

109
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,036
Holly, look, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

110
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,236
Can I please have my own hair back?

111
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,996
- Pretty please, with sugar on?
- I'll think about it, Arnold.

112
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,232
Holly's supposed to have told you.
I thought you didn't mind.

113
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,914
Mind? Mind? Why should I mind?

114
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,470
Three hundred thousand millennia alone,
while you're in suspended animation?

115
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,951
I'll be fine, I'll do that crossword book -
that should kill a couple of centuries.

116
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,157
Holly'll switch you off
until we come back out.

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,473
Even better, switch me on, switch me off,
like I'm some battery-powered sex aid.

118
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,189
- Oh, come on, Rimmer. Don't give me this.
- Don't give you what?

119
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,874
I'm dead, Lister, or hadn't you noticed?

120
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,270
I know you're dead, Rimmer,
don't whinge on about it!

121
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:34,272
Sorry to be a bore.

122
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,637
I mean, you're everything
you were when you were alive.

123
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,439
Same personality, same everything.

124
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,160
Apart from the miniscule
detail that I'm a stiffy.

125
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,272
Rimmer, death isn't the handicap
it used to be in the olden days.

126
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,510
It doesn't screw up
your career like it used to.

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,399
That's what they say, Lister, but if
you had two people coming for a job

128
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,915
and one of them was
dead, which would you pick?

129
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:58,558
it depends which was better qualified.

130
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,076
Bullpats. When was the last
time you saw a dead newsreader?

131
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,959
Channel 27 had a hologram reading the news.

132
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,954
Oh...groovy, funky Channel 27.

133
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,715
Big smegging deal. You livvies hate us deadies.

134
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,675
Rimmer, If I'm gonna go back to Earth,
I'm going to have to go into stasis.

135
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,355
It's gonna take 4,000 years just to turn around.

136
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,637
You can't do a three-point turn when
you're this close to Light speed, you know?

137
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,550
Oh, really? And where did you read that?
The Ladybird Book of Astronavigation?

138
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,109
It happens to be true.

139
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,478
I know, it's true, modo. I have taken
the astronavigation exam. Nine times.

140
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,631
Ten, if you count the time I had my spasm.

141
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:41,834
Rimmer, you'll only be turned off until we get back to Earth.

142
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,480
Where you won't need me,
so I won't get switched back on.

143
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:49,277
They might be able to cure you. They probably
made great advances and that while we've been away.

144
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,195
Oh, yes I expect they cured death
the instant we left Earth.

145
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:56,352
I expect doctors' surgeries
are packed with the dead.

146
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,432
"Hello, Mrs Johnson, take one
of these three times a day,

"you'll soon be living again.
Carole, next corpse, please."

148
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,557
- They might.
- Yes, Lister, they might if the Earth hasn't blown up.

149
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,711
Or the ants haven't taken over.

150
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:13,590
well, you'll be in your element if the insects
are in control. You'll probably get a decent job at last.

151
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,149
- Yeah, yeah.
- You'll probably run for government.

152
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,790
- Yeah, yeah.
- You'll probably even make it as a male model.

153
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,999

# Lunar City 7... #

161
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,711
You can't sing, you know.

162
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:20,119
- You can, can you?
- Oh, just because I'm a toaster, I'm tone deaf?

163
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,271
Well, go on, then.

164
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,510
(SMOOTH VOICE) Welcome to the Starlight Ballroom...

165
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,037
# Fly me to the moon and let me... #

166
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,831
# Lunar City 7... #

167
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,960
(LISTER CONTINUES SINGING)

168
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,870
- What was that?!
- Er, 11:14 Ship Time, Dave.

169
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,474
No, Holly, what was that flash?

170
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,439
We've broken the light barrier 22 hours early.

171
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:53,591
Is everyone all right?

172
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,990
I can't do it. I can't cope.

173
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,230
We're going at the speed of light.
Me bottle's gone.

174
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,919
Holly, is everyone all right?

175
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,477
No, I'm not. I thought
I could navigate at light speed

176
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,915
but I just can't wrap me head round it.

177
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,949
Gordon Bennet, that was a close one!

178
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,949
Holly, what's the problem? You're
supposed to have an IQ of 6,000 aren't ya?

179
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,033
Look, we're travelling faster than the speed of light.

180
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,158
That means, by the time we see something,
we've already passed through it.

181
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,631
Even with an IQ of 6,000,
it's still brown trousers time.

182
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,278
Can I help?

183
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,239
No, it's all right.
I'm getting the hang of it now.

184
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:34,233
Left a bit..straighten her up. I better go.

185
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,230
# To Ganymede and Titan,
Yes, sir, I've been around... #

186
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,276
Rimmer! Rimmer!

187
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,431
(SILENT)

188
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,597
(SILENT)

189
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,709
# To Ganymede and Titan,
Yes, sir, I've been... #

190
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,349
Rimmer!

191
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,717
What? What is it?

192
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,073
Do you see anything really weird in that mirror?

193
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,397
Yes. You, you ugly goit.

194
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,360
- No. It was really odd.
- What was?

195
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,114
Nothing. Forget it, doesn't matter.

196
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,318
- What doesn't matter?
- Nothing, forget it, it doesn't matter.

197
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,069
Lister, have you been at
that marijuana gin again?

198
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,151
I said forget it! It doesn't matter.

199
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:33,880
Fine! Well, if you have more problems with nothing

200
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,873
and things that don't matter,
just scream my name hysterically,

201
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,349
and I'll come pelting down the corridor, alright?

202
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,794
# This little kitty went to stasis...

203
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,679
# This little kitty stayed at home

204
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:52,990
# Ooohh, aaaahh, tcheee...

205
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,232
- # My clothes look good...#
- What are you doing?

206
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,357
I'm doing what you said do.

207
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,673
I said, "take a few essential basics
you couldn't bear to leave behind."

208
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,876
Right. These are all I'm taking.

209
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:09,397
Just these and the other ten racks.
Travel light, move fast.

210
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,835
You can't take all of this. There's no room.

211
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:16,114
OK. Then I'll leave...this.

212
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,996
I'll just have to do without it.

213
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,359
- You can take two suits and that's it!
- Two suits?

214
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,431
- Then I'm staying.
- You can't stay.

215
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:28,797
- When I come out, you'll be dead.
- Two suits IS dead.

216
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:33,315
If I cut off my leg and leave it behind,
can I take three?

217
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,671
Going into stasis in 10 minutes,
I'll meet you in the sleeping quarters.

218
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,079
- Yo, Rimmer, look I've been thinking.
- What?

219
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,357
- You know, about going into stasis and everything?
- How did I do what?

220
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,076
What do you mean, "How did I do what?"

221
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,232
- Lister, don't be a gimboid.
- I'm not being a gimboid.

222
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,994
I've just been in the library thinking, and I've decided...

223
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,196
Shut up.

224
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,838
As I was saying
before I was so rudely interrupted,

225
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,834
I've decided when you go into stasis
I want to stay behind, I wanna be left on.

226
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,389
On your own, for the rest of your life?

227
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,551
- What things?
- Eh?!

228
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,109
- I said, what?!
- What's going on?

229
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,269
- You are space crazy.
- I'M space crazy?!

230
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,751
You're the one who's...space crazy.

231
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,992
Well, it probably is
déja-vu. It sounds like it.

232
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,710
Aaaagh! Rimmer, I've just seen you
walk out of that door.

233
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,269
- What?
- How did you do that?

234
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,876
- How did I do what?
- You just this second walked out of that door.

235
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,951
Lister, don't be a gimboid.

236
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,591
I swear, on me grandmother's life, as you
walked out that door, you came in this one.

237
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:56,271
I've just been in the library, thinking and I've decided...

238
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,510
- Rimmer, I'm telling you...
- Shut up.

239
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,240
As I was saying
before I was so rudely interrupted,

240
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,676
I've decided when you go into stasis
I want to stay behind, I wanna be left on.

241
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,274
Rimmer, you've just come in
and said exactly these things.

242
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,192
- What things?
- You said that.

243
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,351
- I said what?!
- And that. You said that.

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,319
- You are space crazy.
- And then you said...

245
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,277
"Well, it probably is déja-vu."

246
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,079
Well, it probably is
déja-vu. It sounds like it.

247
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
Well, go on, then: shake your head and walk out.

248
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,869
Rimmer, listen. Will you just listen?

249
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,156
My tooth! My tooth! I think I lost my tooth!

250
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,436
Cat, wait. Rimmer, listen.

251
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,758
# I'm gonna eat you little fishies #

252
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:40,480
# I'm gonna eat you litt-- # oh-oh...ah-ha!

253
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,554
I was just making sure your fish are OK.
I wasn't going to eat them.

254
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:49,075
- He just walked past us.
- It must be something to do with light speed.

255
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,720
- Holly, what's going on?
- It's light speed, I bet ya.

256
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,235
- Is your name Holly?
- "Is your name Holly" (?)

257
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,172
- Holly!
- Hmm?

258
00:16:55,196 --> 00:16:56,357
What is going on?

259
00:16:56,520 --> 00:17:01,196
Look, I'm a 10th generation Al hologramic computer.
I'm not your mum.

260
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,635
Yes, fantastic.

261
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,871
Do you want this time? A hand with your homework?

262
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,998
Or would you like me to sew little nametags in your PE kit?

263
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:15,192
Holly, watch my lips. What is hap-pen-ing?

264
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,351
With the mirror, the cat, everything...

265
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,309
Oh that. You're seeing future echoes.
Didn't I explain this to you?

266
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,716
What are future echoes?

267
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,679
- How simple do you want this?
- So Lister can understand it.

268
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,593
Oh, dear.

269
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,751
Difficult, I know.

270
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,991
We're travelling faster than L.S. Right?

271
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,071
- What's LS.?
- Light Speed.

272
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,798
- Smartarse.

273
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,193
Consequently, You're catching up with things you're
about to do before you've actually done them.

274
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,432
- Ah, so we're seeing bits of the future?
- Yes.

275
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,592
See, I told you it was light speed.
You should've asked me.

276
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:52,196
- Can they see us?
- Of course not. Use your loaf.

277
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,797
So, wait. Are you saying the Cat is gonna break
his tooth some time in the future?

278
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,156
Yes, I didn't think you wanted it THIS simple.

279
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,630
Hey, ain't nobody gonna break my tooth.

280
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,837
How long is this going to last?

281
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,470
Until the reverse thrust takes effect
and we drop below light speed.

282
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,951
- What's that photograph?
- It's me and Frankenstein, isn't it?

283
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:16,114
- No. The one with the babies.
- Babies? I've never seen it before.

284
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:19,153
Holly, is this what you call a future echo?

285
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,798
Yes, of course it is! Bozo.

286
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:28,079
Two babies. How do I get two babies?

287
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,834
# Ganymede and Titan,
Yes, sir, I've been around

288
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,797
# But there ain't no place
in the whole of space #

289
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,996
What's this, guys?

290
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,038
"Don't go into stasis.
Please don't leave us with Rimmer."

291
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,680
I'm sorry, guys, I've got to. We need you.

292
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,394
There's nothing for me here.
I want to go back to Earth.

293
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:55,599
Oh, don't do that! I don't care what
it's like. It's gotta be better than this.

294
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:00,516
I don't care if the dolphins have taken over and
all the people are in the human being-atarium. You know?

295
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,591
I just want to find out.

296
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,559
(EXPLOSION)
What was that?!

297
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,312
- What was that?
- Brace yourself for a bit of a shock, Lister

298
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,391
- but I just saw you die.
- What?

299
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,471
I did warn you to brace yourself.

300
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,758
- You didn't give me much of a chance.
- I gave you ample bracing time.

301
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,990
You didn't...you didn't even pause.

302
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:33,913
Well, I'm sorry. I've just had a rather nasty experience.

303
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:39,114
I have just seen someone I know
die in the most hideous, hideous way!

304
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,038
- Yeah, me!
- You were fiddling around with the navicomp...

305
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,555
I don't wanna know. I don't wanna know.

306
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,111
- You don't want to know how you die?
- No! Was it quick?

307
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,552
We-ell, I wouldn't say it was super-fast.

308
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,679
Not if you count the thrashing around
and agonised squealing.

309
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:01,197
- You're really loving this, aren't you?
- What a horrible thing to say.

310
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,431
- It was definitely me?
- Oh, yes.

311
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,830
I don't wanna know.

312
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,957
- How old did I look?
- How old are you now?

313
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:11,590
- 25. How old did I look?
- Mid-twenties.

314
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,719
Smeg! I'm not ready.
I'm not smegging ready!

315
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,518
You did seem surprised.

316
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,229
Ah, did you actually see me face?

317
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,789
You were wearing a hat, but it was definitely you.

318
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,918
Well, there you go. I won't wear
a hat then it can't happen. Can it?

319
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,078
- I can live without a hat.
- Lister, it has happened.

320
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,993
You can't change it any more than you can
change what you had for breakfast yesterday.

321
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,949
It hasn't happened, has it? It has will
have going to have happened,

322
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,398
happened but it hasn't actually
happened, happened yet, actually.

323
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,673
Poppycock. It will be happened,
it shall be going to be happening,

324
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,594
it will be was an event that could
will have been taken place in the future.

325
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,911
Simple as that. Your bucket's been kicked, baby.

326
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,039
- Says you.
- Says me and Albert Einstein, thank you very much.

327
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,475
Albo and I happen to agree on this one -

328
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,471
it's called the Theory of Relativity.

329
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,631
All right. OK. OK.

330
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:09,557
Right. The Cat broke his tooth
in a future echo, right?

331
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:12,280
- If I can stop him breaking it..
- Can't be done.

332
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,079
- Then I can stop me from dying.
- Can't be done.

333
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,151
How would a cat break his tooth?

334
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,740
(HUMS FUNERAL MARCH)

335
00:21:18,764 --> 00:21:22,758
He'd be eating something...
eating something hard.

336
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,238
My robot goldfish!
Eating my robot goldfish.

337
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,358
- Holly, where's the Cat?
- He's just going into your sleeping quarters, Dave.

338
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,431
Oh, Smegging Hell!

339
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,557
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm back. Feeling good.

340
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,990
How am I looking?

341
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,110
Go-oo-od.

342
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,033
I wish I was someone else, then I could kiss me.

343
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,752
I think I'll investigate.. these!

344
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,037
Uh-uh, I just ate. But, one little fishy...

345
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,351
# Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna eat you,
little fishy...

346
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,478
# I'm gonna eat you, little fishy #

347
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:06,393
Oh-eeh-oh...

348
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,074
Yeah, I got you!

349
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,151
I'm gonna...errgh.

350
00:22:12,550 --> 00:22:13,425
[CRACK]

351
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,518
I got the fish, I'm not gonna die.
I'm not gonna die.

352
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,796
Hey, you crazy monkey! You creased my suit.

353
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,556
My tooth! My tooth! I think I've lost my tooth.

354
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:31,792
Lister, allow me to be the first
to offer my commiserations.

355
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,554
You're really, really loving this, aren't ya?

356
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:40,111
"Come on, death isn't the handicap
it used to be in the olden days"!

357
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,272
"It doesn't screw your career up
in the way it used to"!

358
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:46,432
Right. There's always some good
in every situation.

359
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,515
Absolutely, Lister. And in this case, you're about
to do the largest splits you'll ever do in your life.

360
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,792
- I get blown up, then?
- Bits of you do.

361
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:00,318
It's not fair. There's loads of things
I've never done.

362
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,833
Like... I've never had a prawn vindaloo.

363
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:07,438
And I've never read... a book.

364
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:10,670
And I wanted to have a family.

365
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,072
And I wanted to have loads of practice of
the things you've gotta do to get a family.

366
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:21,395
Holly, I'd like to send
an internal memo. Black border.

367
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,154
Begins: "To Dave Lister,

368
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,834
"condolences on your passing away."

369
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:30,629
What's that poem? "Now, weary traveller,

370
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:35,317
"rest your head, for just like me,
you're utterly dead."

371
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:40,353
Emergency. Emergency.
There's an emergency going on.

372
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:43,751
- What is it, Hol?
- There's an emergency, Dave.

373
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,595
The navicomp's overheating.
I need your help in the Drive Room.

374
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,469
- Oooh-ooh-ooh.
- Come in 169, your time is up.

375
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,589
- OK. What was I wearing?
- That jacket and red T-shirt.

376
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:02,637
You said yourself I can't stop it.
Let's get it over with.

377
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,836
Lister, what's that for?

378
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,873
I'm going out like I came in,
screaming and kicking.

379
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:10,156
You can't whack Death on the head.

380
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,713
If he comes near me,
I'm gonna rip his nipples off.

381
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,598
I'm afraid it can't cope with the influx
of data at light speed, Dave.

382
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,194
Could you hook it up to the drive computer for me?

383
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:51,879
Six...

384
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,110
Five...

385
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:59,317
Four...

386
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,711
Three...

387
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,791
Two...

388
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:10,789
Aaaaaaaaaah! One...

389
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,752
I did it! I'm not going to die.

390
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,390
- Aaaaaaaaaah!
- Aaaaaaaah. Dog attack.

391
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,314
- I don't know why you're so chirpy.
- I'm alive.

392
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,710
But for how long? It'll probably
happen tomorrow or Thursday.

393
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,997
- Maybe it's not gonna happen at all.
- It was you. I saw you. I'm sure it was you.

394
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,759
Hello, Dave. This is me. I mean you.

395
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,153
I mean, I am you. This is you aged 171, Dave.

396
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,154
I know you're there,
because when I was your age,

397
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,598
I saw me at my age telling you
what I'm about to tell you,

398
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,711
and you've got to tell you,
when you get to be me.

399
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,471
- Thank heavens, you've still got all your marbles, Lister.
- Shhhhh!

400
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,280
I've got to tell you about Bexley.

401
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:10,791
- Who's Bexley?
- I was always gonna call my second son "Bexley",

402
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,474
- after Jim Bexley Speed.
- Your second son?

403
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,678
- What about your first son?
- Jim! After Jim Bexley Speed.

404
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:20,470
It wasn't you Rimmer saw
in the Drive Room, it was Bexley.

405
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,597
Rimmer, you saw me son die!

406
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,357
Never mind this tott! What about me, old man?

407
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:29,558
What happens to me? Do I become an officer?

408
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,950
Rimmer, I'm gonna have two sons!
Isn't it fantastic?

409
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,316
- But one of them dies.
- Yeah, well, everyone dies.

410
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,553
You're born and you die. The bit in the middle's
called "life", and that's still to come!

411
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,473
Go and get your camera.
You haven't got much time.

412
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:44,871
Get your camera
and run to the medical unit. Run!

413
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,756
What about me? What happens to me?

414
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,315
He can't hear us, Rimmer, he's from the future.

415
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,392
Ah, if I ask you now, you can remember it,

416
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,676
and when you get to be him, and you can tell me.

417
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,398
Boss thinking!

418
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,312
Rimmer, you wanted to know
what happened to you.

419
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:07,270
- Come closer, come closer still.
- Yes. Yes.

420
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,193
- Heh, heh, heh.
- You goit.

421
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,390
No, you goit. They're all goits. I'm
surrounded by goits. Holly, you're a goit.

422
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,551
- I'm a what?
- You heard!

423
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:21,554
What's happening, Hol?
Are we going to see my funeral or something?

424
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:26,396
Look, the faster we go, the more
into the future the future echoes are.

425
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,994
And now, since we've just started to slow down,

426
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:32,118
the future echoes are nearer to the present.
Clear?

427
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,555
- No.
- Tough.

428
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:42,433
Wait a minute. I don't understand
how you're supposed to get two sons,

429
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:45,319
- without a woman on this ship.
- Neither do I.

430
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,676
But it's going to be a laugh finding out.

431
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,993
I can't see you, but I know you can see me.

432
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,117
I'd like you to meet your two sons.

433
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,512
This is Jim and this is Bexley.
Stop crying and say "cheese", boys.

434
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:06,597
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere.

435
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:09,798
# I'm all alone, more or less

436
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,872
# Let me fly, far away from here

437
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,998
# Fun, fun, fun

438
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,118
# In the sun, sun, sun

439
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,159
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

440
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,198
# Drinking fresh mango juice

441
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,716
# Goldfish shoals, nibbling at my toes

442
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,599
# Fun, fun, fun

443
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:35,911
# In the sun, sun, sun

444
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,038
# Fun, fun, fun

445
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,670
# In the sun, sun, sun #
