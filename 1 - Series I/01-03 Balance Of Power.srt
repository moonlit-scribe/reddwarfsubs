00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,990
This is an SOS distress call
from the mining ship Red Dwarf.

3
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,198
The crew are dead, killed by a radiation leak.

4
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:12,237
The only survivors were: Dave Lister,

5
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,073
who was in suspended animation
during the disaster,

6
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:18,073
and his pregnant cat,
who was safely sealed in the hold.

7
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,276
Revived three million years later,

8
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,955
Lister's only companions are
a life form who evolved from his cat

9
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,634
and Arnold Rimmer, a hologram
simulation of one of the dead crew.

10
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,996
In the three million years we have been away,

11
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:34,720
it is my fond hope that mankind
has abolished war,

12
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,077
cured all disease and got rid
of those little western saloon doors

Oh, Rimmer, it's Saturday night. I've had enough.

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,555

23
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,994
Rimmer, will you stop saying
4,981 irradiated haggis, and speak to me?

24
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,234

25
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,955

00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,991
- I want some fun!
- This is fun, are you mad?

28
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,397
You read something out,
I say "check". Where's the fun?

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,918
All right. we'll put you in command
for a few seconds, Cap-i-tain.

30
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,752
What's the plan? Lickety-split.

31
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,355
- Go back to Earth.
- And in the meantime?

32
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,115
I dunno. Just sort of generally
slob around...have a few laughs.

33
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,479
Excellent plan, Lister.
Excellent plan. Brilliant plan.

34
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,513
There was me thinking you hadn't
thought about it but clearly you have.

35
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,319
Right, i'll stand over here
and laugh slobbily, shall I?

36
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,199
Rimmer, i'm going for a drink. Gimme me cigarettes.

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,671
I only owe you four and three quarters.

38
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,112
You owe me five.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
It's one cigarette for each day you obey me.

40
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,751
Well, there you go. Five days, five cigarettes.

41
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,116
Ah, but I'm penalising you
one quarter of a cigarette

42
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:14,237
for saying, "check" in a variety of silly voices,

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:16,311
while doing the homogenised puddings.

44
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,437
Well, I'm taking five.

45
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,275
You take five, Lister, I'll eject the rest
of the ship's stock into space.

46
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:25,796
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
So, they're somewhere near an airlock?

47
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,190
Ha, ha, ha, ha!
You'll never find them, Lister.

48
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,238
I was always a master
at "Hide and Seek" as a child.

- It's not a gift you lose.
- OK, quark brain.

00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,756
Even it out. Take out the flaky bits.

51
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,999
Oh, I really, really hate you, Rimmer.

52
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,358

Holly, why Rimmer's hologram?

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,798
Why did you have to bring
Rimmer's hologram back?

55
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,394
He was the most unpopular man onboard this ship.

56
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,394
I mean, he even had to organise
his own surprise birthday parties.

57
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,716
Who should I have brought back, then?

58
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,360
Anyone. Chen... Petersen...

59
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,353
I mean, Hermann Goering would have
been more of a laugh than Rimmer.

60
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,239
OK, he was a drug-crazed transvestite,

61
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:24,278
but at least we could have gone dancing. Water!

62
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,876
I brought Rimmer back because he's
the best person to keep you sane.

63
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,678
Oh, crap.

64
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,751
Not you!

65
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,430
I do apologise, I wasn't paying attention. See you later.

66
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,953
What about Kristine Kochanski?
You could have brought Kristine back.

67
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,879
Your entire life,
your shared conversations with her

68
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,793
- totalled 173 words.
- So?

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,952
In terms of wordage, you actually had
a better relationship with your rubber plant.

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,715
- I know, but Rimmer?
- He's the person you knew best.

Over 14 million words in all

72

Holly... Seven million of those
were me telling him to smeg off,

73
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,875
and the other seven million were him putting me
on report for telling him to smeg off.

00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,832
Lister, what on Titan is this din?

165
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,275
- LISTER!
(TAPED MUSIC CONTINUES)

166
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,194
- What on Titan is this din?
- It's Rastabilly Skank.

167
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:42,399
Is this it? It's got a health warning on it.
It's bad for you.

168
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,473
- It's a classic.
- "Danger! Government Health Warning:

169
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,836
"this music can make you irritable and irrational,

170
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,958
"and has been linked with disorders
of the nervous system and bowels."

171
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,070
No one takes notice of that stuff.

172
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,629
Lister, if you want to dice with death, fine,

173
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,429
but don't poison my sound waves. Off.
(MUSIC STOPS)

174
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,032
Why don't you listen to something
really classical, like Mozart,

175
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,191
Mendelssohn or Motörhead?

176
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,436
I think I've gone video blind.

177
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,516
Is that painting yours? It's rubbish.

178
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,631
It's a mirror!

179
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,997
I need some sleep.

180
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,790
Rimmer, do you remember Kristine Kochanski?

181
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,113
Navigation Officer?
Yes, I remember her. Snooty cow.

182
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,919
She used to look down on me.
She used to call me "Rimmer".

183
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,671
Everybody called you Rimmer.

184
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,635
Ah, it's the way she said it, though - "Rimmer".

185
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,838
"Rimmer", to rhyme with "scum".

186
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,076
God, she'd a chip on her shoulder, Lister.

187
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,959
- Yeah, Well, I want to go on a date with her.
- Tough. She's dead.

188
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,111
- For just one night...
- No.

189
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,351
- I'm gonna turn you off for just four hours...
- No. No.

190
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,909
- And spend an evening with her hologram...
- No.

191
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,196
- Look, I know you're worried I won't turn you back on...
- No

192
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,238
I promise, I swear if you tell me
where you've hidden the hologram discs...

193
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,075
- No.
- Uh! You're not even prepared to discuss it.

194
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,549
We are discussing it, Lister.

195
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,314
What's this if it's not a discussion?
A diesel locomotive?

196
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,918
I promise, I swear I'll turn you back on.

197
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,276
Is that it, Lister, is that the entire proposal?

198
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,398
- Yes.
- Well, Lister...

199
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,955
No, think about it seriously. Don't just dismiss it.

200
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,236
All right, all right. I'll think about it.

201
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,472
- You're just gonna say "No".
- Don't interrupt. I'm thinking.

202
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,871
- But, you're just gonna say "No".
- Not necessarily. I'm mulling it over.

203
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,074
(CLICKING HIS TEETH)

204
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,114
Yeeeeeee... No.

205
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,592
Look, what is it man, don't you trust me?

206
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:50,355
Black card, Lister. I'm holding up
a black card. Conversation over.

207
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:53,831
I've always been crazy about her
and I never did anything about it.

208
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,150
Oh, Listy, you've forgotten the colour code.

209
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,800
White: The white card is to continue the discussion.

210
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,952
But this is a black card situation. Discussion over.

211
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,316
- Listen.
- # Da-da-da Black card, black card. #

212
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,393
- I was talking about something else.
- White card. Go on.

213
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,552
Right, for a start I want to stop all
this black card, white card smeg,

214
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,836
- it's driving me crazy.
- Black card.

215
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,438
Four hours, I just wanna spend an evening
with her hologram! What's so wrong with that?

216
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,319
You don't know when to stop
do you, Lister? I'm your superior.

217
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:24,279
Technician was the lowest rank on this ship.

218
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,034
The man who changed the bog rolls
was higher than us.

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,439
Yes, well, he's not here now, Lister, and we are.

220
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:33,399
There's still a pecking order
and I'm pecking you, baby.

221
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,910
OK, Rimmer... OK.

222
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,231
- OK?
-Ooooh-kaaay.

223
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,072
- Is that a threat, Lister?
- Yeah.

224
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,119
Actually, "OK", Lister is not a threat,
technically speaking.

225
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:52,033
It is when you mean it to mean what I mean.

226
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,671
I mean it to mean: OK, Rimmer.
Ohh-kaaay!

227
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,958
No, Lister, OK is never a threat, no matter
how many "A"s you put on the end.

228
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,513
I'm going to pass the exams
and become an officer.

229
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,591
Come on. Wise up, Lister.

230
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,240
You'll have to salute me, call me "Sir".

231
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,517
You'll have to give me Kochanski
and me cigarettes.

232
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,877
On that day, Lister,
Satan will be skating to work.

233
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:31,193
Lister! Rise and shine, El Slotho. Come on!

234
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,430
I've been awake for
hours, Lister. Up, up, up.

235
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:36,797
Come on, exercise,
Lister! Exercise, sonny boy-

236
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,316
Quarter to two?

237
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,035
I didn't set my motivator.

238
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:47,590
I was supposed to be up at seven.
Why didn't he wake me?

239
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,671
He knows I'm a heavy sleeper.

240
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,274
Have I got to remind him to do everything for me?

241
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,397
He is so irresponsible.

242
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,869
Holly, give me a cold shower, will you please?

243
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,917
Certainly, Arnold.

244
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,952
Ooooh! Not that cold! Hotter! Hotter!

245
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,111
Aaaargh! Not that hot!

246
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,310
Just forget it. Can you give me a clean uniform?
Perhaps you can manage that?

247
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,876
Thank you, Holly. Where's Lister?

248
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,989
Er, Holly, where's my arm?
This isn't my arm. Whose arm is this?

249
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:20,436
I'm sorry, Arnold, your physical
data disc has become corrupted,

250
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,875
Don't give me excuses.
Give me my arm back.

251
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,429
I'll have to refresh the graphics from a back-up.

252
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:28,034
It's got tattoos. "Candy"?

253
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,192
"Denmark Forever"?
Is this Petersen's arm, Holly?

254
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,949
I've got the arm of a Danish moron.

255
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:36,759
If you will just bear with
me for a few minutes, Arnold.

256
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,958
It's not good enough, Holly.
It's traumatic enough being dead.

257
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,511
And whose ears are these, Holly?

258
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:47,798
They're like two giant radar dishes stuck
higgledy-piggledy to the side of my head.

259
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,235
I mean, just look at them, look at them!

260
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,358
Whose were these ears, Holly -
an African elephant's?

261
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,590
They're your ears, Arnold.

262
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,838
It must have been the way I slept.
I haven't got time for this. Where's Lister?

- Hello, how can I help you?
- Fish.

- Fish.

- I will!

- Mine! The fish is mine!

I don't want your fish,
you stupid cat. Where's Lister?

279
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,670
Idiot! Holly, as senior rank aboard this ship,
I order you to tell me where he is.

280
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,559
- I've told you, I can't.
- Holly, that's an order

281
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,598
- You stupid, ugly goit.
- Ugly?

282
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:07,037
I'll have you know I chose this
face out of the billions available,

283
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,511
'cause it happened to be the face of the
greatest and most prolific lover who ever lived.

284
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,790
Really? Well, he must
have operated in the dark a lot.

285
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,112
- You what?
- And when are you gonna give me my own arm back?

286
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,431
I refuse to walk round all day
with Petersen's arm.

287
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,273
You know what he was like.
God only knows where this arm has been.

288
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,478
Ah! What's he doing?

289
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,399
Beats me, Arnie.
Seems to have a mind of its own.

290
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,591
Tell him to stop it.

291
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:42,356
What is this? A cabaret?
Entertainment while you eat?

292
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,397
No, no, no...

293
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,757
Can you place bets? My bet is on this arm.

294
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,993
Ahhh!

Holly, you're absolutely
gorgeous and handsome

and delicious. Please
tell him to stop it.

297
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,434
All right, just give me
a couple of seconds.

298
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,791
Ah, look at that. I've outwitted him
He's given up. Look, he's given up.

Oooooh!

300
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,717
- Ah!
- There, done it. just in time.

301
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:18,874
Hey! That was good. You should've finished
on a song, it would have been perfect.

302
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,590
I hate everything.

I know you're here, Lister.
You're always here, Sunday afternoons.

Skutters don't have time off.

- Go away, I'm busy.
- Off.

has got the stuff to become an officer?

You've got the brains of diarrhoea
and the breeding of a maggot.

- Dunno.

- Dunno.

00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:21,354
I don't. I expect to pass the chef's exam.

325
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,192
Chef? You want to become a chef?

326
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,874
Not really. I just want to become your superior.

327
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,110
But a chef? A white-hatted ponce?
That's not a real officer.

328
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,351
It outranks you, smeg-for-brains.

329
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,799
And Lister, what's this? Learning drugs?
They're illegal, matey.

330
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:48,273
I'm afraid you're in very serious,
grave, deep trouble, Lister.

331
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,796
Where did you get them?
I want names, places and dates.

332
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,395
Arnold Rimmer. His locker. This morning.

333
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:58,830
Why am I worried? You'll
never stick at it. You'll never pass.

334
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,230
Say "You'll never
pass, Mister Lister, sir".

335
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,709
Practise, Rimmer, makes perfect.

336
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,953
Question four... underline that.

337
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:15,033
What does the red spectrum
tell us about quasars?

338
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,432
Ohhhhh... I'm gonna die!

339
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,830
I've been "fished" to death.

340
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,879
My answer: in answering the question,

341
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,271
"What does the red spectrum
tell us about quasars?"...

342
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,433
Write bigger. "There are various
words that need to be defined.

343
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,117
"What is a spectrum?
What is a red one? why is it red?

344
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,478
"And why is it so frequently
linked with quasars?"

345
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:47,310
What the hell is a quasar?

346
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,960
Just put a neat cross through it.
we'll do the next one. OK?

347
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,839
(LISTER APPROACHING)
..and I think that confidently

348
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,117
and concisely answers the question,
"What does the red spectrum tell us about quasars!"

349
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,151
- Da-dum!
- Lister, did you make that?

350
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:04,073
Yeah. It's not that good.
It was supposed to be roast beef.

351
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,558
Do you want some, Cat?
It's got real cream and fudge in it.

352
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,553
Oh, no, I think I'm going to have to go
and do something secret.

353
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,953
Aaaaah! Look out! Food escape!

354
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,273
- So, Lister, you doing all right, yeah?
- Not bad. Not bad at all.

355
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:32,629
Listen, Lister, all this tension
between us is stupid.

356
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,918
There's just no need for it.
I mean, you're tense and I'm tense.

357
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,196
And there's just absolutely no need for it.

358
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,874
- I'm not tense.
- Of course you're tense...

359
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,476
You rectum-faced pygmy!
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

360
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,795
I mean, there's no need for you
to be slogging your guts out.

361
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:54,635
- I'm enjoying it.
- Shut up. Doing an exam and doing so well.

362
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,996
There's absolutely no need for it, Lister.

363
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:58,991
You can have the
cigarettes, they're in Pipeline 22.

364
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:02,471
- I know.
- Good.

365
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:06,315
The Cat betrayed me.
I don't mind. I'm delighted.

366
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,518
What I'm saying is, Lister, is: there's no need
for us to be at loggerheads.

367
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:14,355
- I mean, we're mates, we're pals.
- When?

368
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,833
Oh, come on, Lister. Laugh, laugh,
laugh, chuckle, guffaw, giggle.

369
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,435
- That's Rimsy and Listy.
- When?

370
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,319
- Millions of times.
- When?

371
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,431
Ah! Oh...
Ah, how about the time

372
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:31,353
your safety harness snapped
and you fell into the cargo bay?

373
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:35,070
- We laughed then, didn't we?
- I cracked me spine in three places.

374
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,399
Yes, but it was hilarious. We laughed like drains.

375
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,473
You laughed. I spent six weeks in traction.

376
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,585
Yes! That's right, that's right,
and you spent the rest

377
00:23:43,609 --> 00:23:45,594
of the summer walking
around like a croquet hoop.

378
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,832
I laughed so hard I
nearly puked. I really did.

379
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,556
- What are you saying to me, Rimmer?
- I'm just saying, Lister,

380
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,519
That, with times as good as those,

381
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:59,639
there's no point in letting
something small and silly like this

382
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,270
come between a friendship
that we've nurtured,

383
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,000
like a small flower, petal by petal,

384
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,075
and watched blossom and bloom
into something rare and special.

385
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,117
OK. Give me Kochanski.

386
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,396
Smeg off, dishwasher breath.

387
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,517
You won't turn me back on.

388
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,956
What, Rimsy-wimsy-mimsy,
me bestest-ever pal?

389
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,350
Alright, Lister, I order you not to take those exams.

390
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,554
Black card, Rimmer.

391
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,709
YOU are black carding ME?

392
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,871
That's only the beginning, Rimmer.

393
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,396
When I pass the exams
and become an officer, you'll be on latrines.

394
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,835
You'll have the three o'clock watch every morning

395
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:40,514
and I know you'll obey me, because you. I mean YOU,

396
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,796
respect all that officer smeg.

397
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,838
If you mean I respect my superiors,
no matter who they are

398
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:50,312
and I obey orders blindly
and unquestioningly...yes! Yes, I do.

399
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,951
That's exactly what I mean.
Anyway, I've got to get some sleep.

400
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,634
Hard day's revision on the morrow.

401
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:01,149
You always become the thing you hate the most.

402
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,996
Look at you, Lister. Obnoxious,
ruthless, single-minded,

403
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,630
insensitive... you're more like me than I am.

404
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,519
Rimmer, you've forgotten the colour code.

405
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,877
This is a black card situation -
end of conversation.

406
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,954
"You never learn, do you?"

407
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:28,629
Chef Part One Examination.
Please proceed to the Teaching Room.

408
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,352
You're not ready for it, you know.
You should be doing last-second revision.

409
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,636
I am. I'm revising buns.

410
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,477
It's obscene, missing the entire
first minute of the exam.

411
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,719
OK, here we go.

412
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:48,156
No. You can't do this to me, Lister.

413
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,311
- Give me Kochanski.
- No.

414
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,349
That was a lousy thing to do to a hologram.
Have you no respect for the dead?

415
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,351
(PING)

416
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,476
- Hello, Dave.
- Aaaaaagh!

417
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:22,555
I'm just doing this,
er.. I'm taking, er... This is a surprise.

418
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:28,434
Dave, why didn't you just tell me how
you felt about me when I was still alive?

419
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,673
Because I'm a dope and I'm a bum,
and I'm stupid, I'm an idiot

420
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,195
and I'm hopeless and I'm useless.

421
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:37,271
Sorry, but I just don't like you.

422
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,637
Oh-ey, I'm really embarrassed now.
I don't know what to say.

423
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,678
It's sort of pointless you doing the exam now.

424
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,116
Well, yeah, It's sort of pointless me breathing
in and out if you want to know the truth.

425
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,557
I could never love anyone like you.

426
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:57,032
So, you might as well pack up
your pots and pans and off you go.

427
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,272
I need a man who's going places.

428
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,954
Up, up, up the ziggurat, lickety-split.

429
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,197
So, it didn't mean anything to you, then?

430
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,871
- What didn't?
- You know, when we...

431
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,000
Made love on the snooker table, behind the bins.

432
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,270
- You never told me that!
- I thought you might have noticed.

433
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:23,080
Oh, yes, yes. I remember now.

434
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,550
We've never made love. Go away, Rimmer.

435
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,519
Look, I'm a bit out of sorts at the moment.

436
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:32,719
- I'm having a woman's period.
- A woman's period?

437
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,792
Women don't speak like that.
Give me a break.

438
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:39,475
I don't know how you've done it, Rimmer,
but that is not Kochanski.

439
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,035
It's Kochanski's body, it's Kochanski's voice.

440
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:44,157
What's the difference, come on?

441
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,153
The difference is that *you're* in there, urgh...

442
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,519
Well, you can't blame me for trying.

443
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:57,120
- Leave.
- I've seen something you haven't, squire.

444
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,800
OK, Holly, swap discs.

445
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,233
Er, Holly, this is not my breast.

446
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,158
I want my own nipple back.

447
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:20,317
- Leave, Rimmer.
- There's no rush, Holly.

448
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,594
Holly, are you sure these are my hips?

449
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,279
Lister: 169-12-14-6.

450
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,431
How did you do?

451
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,349
How did you do?

452
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:56,438
- How did you do, Lister?
- How did I do, Mister Lister, SIR?

453
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:05,513
# It's cold outside
There's no kind of atmosphere

454
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,956
# I'm all alone, more or less

455
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:12,158
# Let me fly far away from here

456
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,834
# Fun, fun, fun

457
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:18,629
# In the sun, sun, sun

458
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,156
# I want to lie, shipwrecked and comatose

459
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,358
# Drinking fresh mango juice

460
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,956
# Goldfish shoals nibbling at my toes

461
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,680
# Fun, fun, fun

462
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:35,071
# In the sun, sun, sun

463
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:38,357
# Fun, fun, fun

464
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,035
 # In the sun, sun, sun #
